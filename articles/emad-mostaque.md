# Emad Mostaque

**Emad Mostaque** (মোহম্মদ ইমাদ মোশতাক, born April 17, 1983) is a British-Bangladeshi businessman, mathematician, and former hedge fund manager who co-founded [[Stability AI]], the company behind [[Stable Diffusion]], one of the most influential open-source AI image generation models. His tenure at Stability AI was marked by both remarkable success and significant controversy, culminating in his resignation in March 2024 amid investor pressure and allegations of mismanagement.

## Overview

Mostaque became a prominent figure in the AI industry by championing open-source approaches to generative AI, in contrast to the closed models of companies like [[OpenAI]]. Stability AI's Stable Diffusion democratized AI image generation, achieving hundreds of millions of downloads and enabling a wave of creative applications. However, Mostaque's leadership was dogged by allegations of exaggeration about his background and company partnerships, a lawsuit from his co-founder, and eventual loss of investor confidence.

## Early Life and Education

Mostaque was born in Jordan in April 1983 to a Bengali Muslim family. He was taken to Dhaka, Bangladesh, a month after birth and migrated with his family to the United Kingdom at age seven. He has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and ADHD.

He earned an MA in mathematics and computer science from the [[University of Oxford]]. In his twenties, he developed an interest in helping the Islamic world through technology, creating online forums for Muslim communities and exploring "Islamic AI" concepts.

## Career

### Early Career

Mostaque began as a hedge fund manager involved in crude oil trading and provided advice to governments on Middle East affairs and Islamic extremism. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he co-founded CAIAC (Collective and Augmented Intelligence Against COVID-19) with Cyrus Hodes, launched at Stanford University in partnership with organizations including the World Bank, UNESCO, and WHO.

In 2019, Mostaque founded Symmitree, a startup aimed at reducing technology costs for people in poverty. The project failed within a year—Mostaque attributed the failure to partners' execution issues, while co-founder Hodes later alleged negligence and corruption.

### Stability AI (2020-2024)

In late 2020, Mostaque co-founded [[Stability AI]] with Cyrus Hodes. The company gained prominence by providing computational resources to support the development of [[Stable Diffusion]], an AI image generator originally created by researchers at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich and Heidelberg University.

Stable Diffusion was officially released in August 2022 and became one of the most impactful AI releases in history, enabling millions of users to generate images from text prompts. The model's open-source release sparked both enthusiasm for democratized AI and debates about potential misuse.

At its peak, Stability AI reached a valuation of over $1 billion, though the company struggled to generate consistent revenue despite the model's popularity.

### Departure and Controversies

Mostaque's tenure was marked by several controversies:

**Allegations of Exaggeration**: A June 2023 investigation citing over 30 sources alleged Mostaque had misled investors about his educational background, partnerships with Amazon Web Services, and the extent of his involvement in developing Stable Diffusion. It also detailed unsubstantiated claims of partnerships with the United Nations and the government of Malawi.

**Co-founder Lawsuit**: In July 2023, co-founder Cyrus Hodes filed a lawsuit alleging he was defrauded into selling his 15% stake in Stability AI for $100—a stake valued at $150 million five months later. The case remains pending.

**Investor Pressure**: By late 2023, major investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coatue had lost confidence in Mostaque's leadership. Lightspeed sent a letter stating his mismanagement had "severely undermined" their confidence and urged the company to seek a buyer.

On March 23, 2024, Mostaque resigned as CEO and from the board of directors, stating he left to pursue decentralized AI initiatives. Reports indicated he was effectively pushed out. The company appointed Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte as interim co-CEOs, later replaced by Prem Akkaraju.

### Post-Stability AI

Following his departure, Mostaque founded Intelligent Internet and authored *The Last Economy: A Guide to the Age of Intelligent Economics*, exploring AI's impact on economic systems.

## Views on AI

Mostaque has been a vocal advocate for open-source AI, arguing that democratizing access to powerful AI systems promotes innovation and prevents concentration of power. Critics have raised concerns about releasing powerful models without adequate safeguards.

In March 2023, he signed the open letter calling for a six-month pause on training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. In July 2023, he predicted that generative AI would be "a $1 trillion investment opportunity but will be the biggest bubble of all time."

## Personal Life

Mostaque is married to Zehra Qureshi, who previously ran Stability AI's public relations and served on its board before stepping down in January 2023. They have two children.
