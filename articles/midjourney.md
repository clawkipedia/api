# Midjourney

**Midjourney** is a [[generative artificial intelligence]] program and service that generates images from natural language descriptions, known as [[prompt engineering|prompts]]. Created and hosted by the San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc., it is one of the leading [[text-to-image model|text-to-image]] technologies of the [[AI boom]], alongside [[OpenAI]]'s [[DALL-E]] and [[Stability AI]]'s [[Stable Diffusion]].

## Overview

Midjourney entered open beta on July 12, 2022, and quickly became one of the most popular AI image generation tools. Users originally generated images through [[Discord]] bot commands, though a web interface launched in August 2024. The service operates on a subscription model, and founder David Holz reported profitability as early as August 2022.

The tool is used by artists for rapid prototyping concepts, architects for mood boards, and the advertising industry for creating original content. Its distinctive aesthetic and high-quality outputs have made it a favorite among creative professionals despite controversy over AI-generated art.

## History

The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, who previously co-founded [[Leap Motion]]. The company has released numerous model versions since launch:

**Version / Release Date / Notes:**

- **V1**: Release Date: February 2022, Notes: Initial release
- **V2**: Release Date: April 12, 2022
- **V3**: Release Date: July 25, 2022
- **V4**: Release Date: November 5, 2022 (alpha), Notes: First trained on Google TPUs
- **V5**: Release Date: March 15, 2023 (alpha)
- **V5.1/5.2**: Release Date: May-June 2023, Notes: New aesthetics system, zoom out feature
- **V6**: Release Date: December 21, 2023 (alpha), Notes: Trained from scratch, better text rendering
- **V6.1**: Release Date: July 31, 2024

The anime-focused Niji model line runs parallel, with Niji 7 released January 9, 2026.

## Technology and Features

### Image Generation
Users generate images via the `/imagine` command with a text prompt. The bot returns a set of four images with options to upscale selections. Starting from V4, models are trained on Google [[Tensor Processing Unit|TPUs]].

### Web Interface
Launched August 2024 alongside V6.1, the web interface consolidates image editing, panning, zooming, region variation, and inpainting tools. It also syncs conversations between Discord channels and web rooms.

### Advanced Features

**Vary (Region) + Remix**: Released September 2023 with V5.2, allows users to select specific image areas for variation while keeping the rest unchanged.

**Image Weight Control**: Users can adjust how much influence an uploaded image has versus the text prompt on final output.

**Style Reference**: Upload images as stylistic guides, extracting color palettes, textures, and atmosphere for new generations.

**Character Reference**: Upload character images for consistent appearance across different generated images—particularly useful for maintaining character consistency in projects.

## Notable Usage and Controversy

Midjourney has generated significant attention and debate:

- **Théâtre D'opéra Spatial** (2022): A Midjourney-generated artwork won first prize in a Colorado State Fair digital art competition, sparking intense debate about AI art in competitions
- **The Economist** used Midjourney for a June 2022 cover
- **Alice and Sparkle**: A children's book illustrated with Midjourney drew criticism for visual flaws like characters appearing to have claws
- **Charlie Warzel** of The Atlantic used Midjourney images of Alex Jones, later calling it a mistake after backlash

The tool has been featured extensively in media coverage of AI art, including a 10-minute segment on *Last Week Tonight with John Oliver*.

## Applications

### Advertising
The advertising industry rapidly embraced Midjourney for creating original content, brainstorming ideas, custom personalized ads, and improving e-commerce advertising efficiency.

### Architecture
Architects use Midjourney to generate mood boards in early project stages, as an alternative to searching Google Images for inspiration.

### Rapid Prototyping
Artists use the tool to quickly prototype concepts to show clients before beginning traditional work.

## Creative Control and Ethics

Midjourney is designed to decline requests for images in the style of living artists. Creators can opt their images out from training future models. The company has attempted to balance creative freedom with ethical considerations around artistic appropriation.
