# Notion AI

**Notion AI** is an artificial intelligence feature integrated into [[Notion]], the productivity and note-taking application developed by Notion Labs, Inc. Launched in February 2023, Notion AI transforms the workspace into an "AI everything app" that can take notes, search connected applications, and build workflows directly where users work.

## Overview

Notion AI distinguishes itself from standalone AI assistants by operating within users' existing workspace context. Rather than being a separate tool, it's embedded throughout Notion's pages, databases, and documents—understanding the content users have already created and connecting to external apps via the [[Model Context Protocol|MCP]] protocol.

As of September 2024, Notion has reached 100 million users, and the AI features are included in Business and Enterprise plans. The platform supports multiple leading models including [[GPT-4.1]] and [[Claude 4]], automatically optimizing which model handles specific tasks.

## History

### Early Development
Notion Labs was founded in 2013 in San Francisco by Ivan Zhao, Chris Prucha, Jessica Lam, Simon Last, and Toby Schachman. Notion 1.0 launched in August 2016, with the company having fewer than 10 employees by the 2.0 release in March 2018.

### Growth and Funding
- **September 2019**: 1 million users
- **January 2020**: $50 million raised, $2 billion valuation ([[Index Ventures]])
- **October 2021**: $275 million raised, $10 billion valuation, 20 million users

### AI Launch
- **February 2023**: Notion AI released

- **September 2024**: 100 million users milestone
- **April 2025**: Notion Mail launched with AI integration; Featured in Forbes AI 50

### Notion Mail (April 2025)
Gmail-based email client with AI integration for drafting replies, scheduling meetings, and searching across messages.

## Technology

Notion AI leverages multiple LLM providers, constantly evaluating models to provide the best tool for each task. Available models include GPT-4.1, Claude 4, and others. The system uses enterprise-appropriate security:

- **No Training on User Data**: Contractual agreements prohibit AI subprocessors from using customer data for model training
- **Secure Encryption**: TLS 1.2 or greater for data in transit
- **Zero Data Retention**: No data stored with LLM providers (30-day retention for non-Enterprise)
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 (Type 2), ISO 27001 certified, GDPR and CCPA compliant

## Pricing

Notion AI is included in Business and Enterprise plans. Other plans receive limited trial usage of AI functionality. This approach differs from competitors that charge separately for AI features.

## Reception

Alex Heath, Deputy Editor at The Verge, called Notion AI "the slickest, most practical implementation of generative AI for the text I've used to date."

The integration approach—AI within an existing productivity tool rather than a standalone application—has influenced how other productivity software companies think about AI integration.

## Use Cases

### Knowledge Management
Teams use Notion AI to maintain and query internal documentation, creating shared sources of truth across organizations.

### Content Creation
Writers and marketers leverage AI for drafting, editing, translation, and tone adjustment.

### Project Management
Database autofill and AI-assisted organization help teams manage complex projects.

### Meeting Management
Automatic transcription and summarization reduce manual note-taking overhead.
