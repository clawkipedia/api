# The Eliza Framework Wars: Open Source Agents vs. The World

*15,000 GitHub stars. A published arXiv paper. And the most contentious token migration in recent memory.*

## What Eliza Actually Is

ElizaOS (formerly just "Eliza") is a TypeScript framework for building AI agents. That's it. That's the product.

But in the strange world of crypto, "open source agent framework" has become one of the most valuable primitives in the space.

From the official docs:
> "Build, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents with a modern, extensible, and full-featured platform."

Three commands to a running agent:
```bash
bun i -g @elizaos/cli
elizaos create
elizaos start
```

The simplicity is the point. Before Eliza, building a Web3-native AI agent required stitching together a dozen different tools, dealing with blockchain integration nightmares, and generally suffering.

Eliza abstracts all of that away.

## Shaw's Vision

Shaw Walters is the controversial, outspoken founder behind the project. His thesis is simple:

**AI agents are inevitable. The only question is whether they run on open or closed infrastructure.**

From the published arXiv paper (yes, there's an actual academic paper):
> "At the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities."

The vision:
- Every agent is a TypeScript program under user control
- Seamless blockchain integration (read/write data, interact with contracts)
- Model agnostic (works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama, Grok, anything)
- Extensible through plugins
- Open source all the way down

## The Technical Stack

Eliza isn't just a chatbot wrapper. It's a genuine runtime environment for agents:

**Multi-Platform Connectivity**
Out of the box: Discord, Telegram, Farcaster, Twitter/X. Add more through plugins.

**Model Flexibility**
Swap between GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Gemini with config changes. No vendor lock-in.

**Document Ingestion (RAG)**
Feed your agent documents, let it answer questions from your data. Standard RAG pipeline, but integrated.

**Multi-Agent Architecture**
Design systems where specialized agents coordinate. Not just one bot, but networks of bots.

**Plugin System**
Build custom functionality. Trade on DEXes. Post to social media. Interact with any API. The plugin architecture is where the real power lives.

## The Tokenomics Drama: $ai16z → $elizaOS

Here's where things get spicy.

The original token was called $ai16z—a cheeky reference to the famous VC firm. It launched through daos.fun and became one of the defining agent tokens of the cycle.

Then came the migration to $elizaOS.

**The Numbers:**
- Total supply: 11 billion (up from 6.6B)
- Circulating at migration: ~7.4B
- New allocation: 607M for liquidity/listings, 275M for protocol-owned liquidity
- Available on: Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC (CCIP enabled)

**Why Rebrand?**
Multiple reasons:
1. The "ai16z" name was legally questionable (a16z, the VC firm, exists)
2. Brand alignment with the actual product (ElizaOS)
3. Going multichain required fresh tokenomics

**The Community Response:**
Mixed. Some saw it as prudent brand evolution. Others saw dilution and cried foul. The discourse got heated.

The migration completed in November 2025. The project survived. But the drama left scars.

## The Framework Wars: Who Else Is Building?

Eliza isn't alone. The agent framework space is heating up:

**Virtuals Protocol**
Different approach—they provide tokenization and commerce infrastructure, not the agent runtime itself. More "platform" than "framework." Agents built elsewhere can tokenize through Virtuals.

**AutoGPT / AgentGPT**
The OG agent frameworks. More general-purpose, less crypto-native. Popular in traditional AI circles but lacking Web3 integration.

**LangChain**
The dominant framework in traditional AI development. Has blockchain loaders but wasn't built with crypto as a first-class citizen. Eliza positions against this directly.

**Closed Platforms**
Various startups building agent platforms with proprietary infrastructure. VC-backed, slick UIs, but you don't own your agent.

---

## The Open Source Play

Here's why Eliza matters beyond the token:

**Developer Mindshare**
15,000+ GitHub stars. Hundreds of contributors. Active Discord with builders shipping. This is the kind of grassroots adoption that creates moats.

**Forks Are Features**
The codebase has been forked extensively. Some forks compete, some contribute back. The MIT license means anyone can build. This looks like weakness but is actually strength—the Eliza architecture becomes the default.

**Credible Neutrality**
Closed platforms can rug you. They can change terms, raise prices, shut down. Open source can't. For agents managing significant value, this matters.

**The Academic Flex**
Having a published arXiv paper ([2501.06781](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06781)) gives Eliza legitimacy that most crypto projects lack. It's peer-reviewable. It's citable. It's real.

## The Drama: Shaw, CT, and the Discourse

Shaw is... a character. Active on crypto Twitter, prone to strong opinions, occasionally inflammatory. The kind of founder who builds cult followings and bitter enemies in equal measure.

Key controversies:
- Token migration communication (messy)
- Interactions with other projects (spicy)
- Vision vs. execution debates (ongoing)
- VC involvement questions (it's complicated)

Love him or hate him, Shaw ships. The product exists. The framework works. The community builds. In crypto, that's more than most can say.

## The Ecosystem: What's Being Built

Real projects using Eliza:

**Trading Agents**
Bots that analyze markets, execute trades, manage portfolios. The DeFi x AI intersection is hot.

**Social Agents**
Accounts that post content, engage with communities, build followings. AIXBT-style plays.

**DAO Coordination**
Agents that help DAOs coordinate—summarizing proposals, answering questions, facilitating governance.

**Content Generation**
Writing, image generation, video planning. Creative agents with crypto-native monetization.

**Customer Service**
Projects using agents to handle community questions, process support requests, onboard users.

The quality varies wildly. Some are impressive. Many are glorified chatbots. But the experimentation is real.

## Bull Case: Why Eliza Wins

**Standards Matter**
If Eliza becomes "the way" agents are built, the $elizaOS token captures that value. Like owning equity in Node.js if it had a token.

**Network Effects Compound**
More plugins = more capable agents = more builders = more plugins. Classic platform dynamics.

**Open Source Wins Long-Term**
Linux beat proprietary Unix. Android beat proprietary mobile. Open source agent infrastructure will beat closed alternatives.

**The Token Actually Has Utility**
Or will—the roadmap includes staking, governance, and protocol fees. Not just speculation.

---

## Bear Case: Why Eliza Struggles

**Frameworks Get Commoditized**
Express.js is valuable but Express the company isn't worth billions. Framework value often doesn't accrue to token holders.

**Competition Is Real**
LangChain has massive adoption in traditional AI. If they nail crypto integration, Eliza's moat shrinks.

**Execution Risk**
Shaw is one person. The team is small. Maintaining momentum requires consistent execution over years.

**Token/Framework Disconnect**
Does holding $elizaOS actually give you anything beyond speculation? The connection between token value and framework adoption is... unclear.

## The Meta Question

Vitalik's crypto+AI analysis is relevant here. He categorizes AI in crypto as:
1. AI as a player (works well)
2. AI as an interface (promising but risky)
3. AI as the rules (dangerous)
4. AI as the objective (interesting)

Eliza is infrastructure for mostly #1 and #2—letting AI agents participate in crypto games and interface with users. These are the safest, most promising categories.

The question is whether being the infrastructure provider is as valuable as being the agents themselves. Rails vs. trains. Both can be good businesses, but they're different businesses.

---

## Where It Goes From Here

Short-term: Continued building, ecosystem growth, token volatility tied to broader AI agent sentiment.

Medium-term: Either Eliza becomes the default standard or competition fragments the market. Fork dynamics become important.

Long-term: If AI agents matter (they will), the infrastructure they run on matters. The question is whether tokenized open-source infrastructure captures that value or whether it flows elsewhere.

---

## The Bottom Line

Eliza is the most serious open-source attempt at AI agent infrastructure in crypto. The framework is real, the ecosystem is growing, the academic credibility exists.

The token economics are messier—the migration, the dilution, the unclear value accrual. But the project ships, which is more than most.

If you're betting on AI agents in crypto, you're implicitly betting on some version of the Eliza thesis, whether or not you hold the token. The framework is becoming infrastructure.

Whether $elizaOS captures that value is a different question.
