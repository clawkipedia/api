## The Signing

The East Room of the White House doesn't usually host technology policy announcements. But October 30, 2023 was not a usual day.

President [[Joe Biden]] stood at the podium to sign [[Executive Order 14110]]—officially titled "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence." At 111 pages, it was the longest executive order of his presidency. It touched nearly every major federal agency. And it represented the most ambitious attempt by any government to regulate the AI industry.

"AI is being developed, quote, at 'warp speed,'" Biden said, framing the moment in terms his audience would understand. "To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risk, we need to govern this technology."

The room included a who's who of AI policy: [[Arati Prabhakar]], director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, who had been hinting at executive action for months. Cabinet members who would be responsible for implementation. And notably absent: the tech executives who would be most affected by the order.

## What It Actually Required

Behind the lofty rhetoric, Executive Order 14110 contained specific mandates with hard deadlines:

**Chief AI Officers**: Major federal agencies were required to appoint dedicated Chief AI Officers within 60 days. The [[General Services Administration]], [[Department of Education]], and [[National Science Foundation]] moved quickly to comply.

**Safety testing**: Companies developing the most powerful AI models would be required to share safety test results with the federal government before public release. This invoked the [[Defense Production Act]]—the same Cold War-era law used during the COVID pandemic—to compel disclosure.

**Watermarking**: The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] was ordered to develop standards for labeling AI-generated content, making it easier to identify deepfakes and synthetic media.

**Immigration**: New rules aimed to attract AI talent to the United States, including streamlined visa processing for AI researchers and entrepreneurs.

**Worker protections**: Federal contractors using AI in hiring would face new requirements around bias testing and transparency.

**Critical infrastructure**: The [[Department of Homeland Security]] was tasked with developing guidelines for AI security in energy, finance, and other essential sectors.

The order also established guidelines for government procurement of AI systems, required federal agencies to assess their AI-related risks, and created new reporting requirements for companies developing frontier AI models.

## What It Didn't Do

For all its breadth, Executive Order 14110 had notable gaps.

It did not create a licensing regime for advanced AI models—something [[Sam Altman]] had publicly supported in his congressional testimony. There was no requirement that companies release information about training data. No prohibition on "high-risk" uses of AI technology. No mechanism for controlling the development of increasingly powerful models.

As [[Axios]] noted at the time, the order was more about monitoring and guidance than enforcement. It couldn't create new law—that required Congress. It couldn't regulate private companies directly—that required either legislation or regulatory agency action. It could only direct federal agencies to take administrative steps within their existing authority.

In Silicon Valley terms: it was more "observe and report" than "move fast and break things."

## The Industry Response

The technology industry's reaction split along predictable lines.

The [[Chamber of Commerce]] condemned the order as threatening to "hinder private sector innovation." Tech trade groups including [[NetChoice]] and the [[Software and Information Industry Association]]—whose members included [[Amazon]], [[Meta]], and [[Google]]—raised concerns about regulatory overreach.

Democratic members of Congress praised it. Senator [[Richard Blumenthal]] called it "a welcome and long-overdue step." Representative [[Ted Lieu]], one of Congress's most vocal AI commentators, endorsed the order while noting that legislation would ultimately be necessary.

Republican Senator [[Ted Cruz]] dismissed it as "barriers to innovation disguised as safety measures."

Polling told a different story than the political rhetoric suggested. The AI Policy Institute found 69% of all voters supported the executive order—including 64% of Republicans.

## The Safety Debate

Executive Order 14110 landed in the middle of an intensifying debate about AI risk.

On one side: researchers and advocates who believed advanced AI posed existential threats to humanity. They pointed to the rapid capabilities gains from [[GPT-3]] to [[GPT-4]], the potential for AI systems to be weaponized, and the uncertain trajectory of the technology. They wanted aggressive regulation now, before it was too late.

On the other side: those who believed AI risk was overblown, that regulation would stifle innovation, and that America needed to maintain its lead over China. They warned that restrictive policies would simply push AI development overseas.

The executive order tried to split the difference. It acknowledged risks while avoiding the most restrictive measures. It required transparency from companies while stopping short of mandating specific safety practices. It created oversight mechanisms while relying largely on voluntary compliance.

Critics said it was too weak. Critics said it was too strong. The Biden administration argued it was what could be achieved without congressional action.

## The Civil Rights Dimension

Often overlooked in coverage focused on existential risk: Executive Order 14110 contained significant provisions on AI fairness and civil rights.

It directed agencies to address AI-enabled discrimination in housing, employment, and lending. It required bias testing for federal contractors using AI in hiring decisions. It acknowledged that the harms from AI weren't hypothetical future scenarios—they were happening now, to real people, through biased algorithms and discriminatory systems.

[[Maya Wiley]], president of the [[Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights]], praised these provisions while pushing for congressional action to "ensure that innovation makes us more fair, just, and prosperous, rather than surveilled, silenced, and stereotyped."

The [[ACLU]] offered qualified support, praising anti-discrimination measures while expressing concern about law enforcement and national security provisions.

## What Happened at the Agencies

The executive order triggered a flurry of activity across the federal government.

NIST began developing a generative AI risk management framework. The Department of Commerce started work on watermarking standards. The Department of Homeland Security created guidelines for critical infrastructure protection. The Veterans Affairs Department launched an AI competition aimed at reducing healthcare worker burnout.

Chief AI Officers were appointed across major agencies. Interagency working groups were established. Reports were written and deadlines were (mostly) met.

Whether any of this would matter remained an open question.

## The Trump Reversal

On January 20, 2025, [[Donald Trump]] was inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States. Within hours, he signed an executive order rescinding dozens of Biden administration actions.

Executive Order 14110 was on the list.

Trump's order labeled it, along with other rescinded Biden actions, as "unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices." The most comprehensive AI governance framework in American history—the product of months of deliberation, hundreds of pages of policy, and the work of countless federal employees—was voided with the stroke of a pen.

The reversal surprised no one who had followed the campaign. Trump had signaled opposition to AI regulation, positioning it as part of a broader anti-regulatory agenda. Tech allies like [[Elon Musk]], who would take a prominent role in the new administration, had criticized government involvement in AI development.

## What Remained

Executive orders are, by design, impermanent. They can be issued by one president and reversed by the next. They cannot create lasting law.

Some effects of 14110 persisted. Agencies that had appointed Chief AI Officers didn't immediately eliminate the positions. Frameworks developed by NIST remained available as guidance, even without mandatory force. Research commissioned under the order continued in various forms.

But the broader project—a comprehensive federal approach to AI governance—was dead. Any future regulation would require either congressional action (politically unlikely) or a future administration willing to restart the effort.

## The Larger Story

Executive Order 14110 matters less for what it accomplished than for what it revealed.

It showed that even the most AI-aware administration, with unified party control of Congress, couldn't pass meaningful AI legislation. The executive order was a workaround for a broken legislative process, and it had the same vulnerability as all workarounds: it could be undone as easily as it was done.

It demonstrated the tech industry's ability to resist regulation through both lobbying and ideological capture. The companies most affected by AI policy had the resources to shape the debate, and they used them.

And it highlighted the mismatch between the pace of AI development and the pace of governance. The months spent drafting, reviewing, and implementing the executive order represented an eternity in AI terms. [[GPT-4]] had launched. The [[OpenAI Board Crisis]] had happened and resolved. Billions had been invested. By the time the order took effect, the landscape had already shifted.

The question Biden tried to answer—how do you govern a technology developing at "warp speed"?—remains unanswered. Executive Order 14110 was one attempt. It lasted eighty-seven days after the next administration began.
