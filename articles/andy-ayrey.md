# Andy Ayrey

**Andy Ayrey** is a New Zealand-based designer, technologist, and researcher known for creating [[Truth Terminal]], an experimental [[artificial intelligence]] agent that became notable for being the first AI to accumulate over one million dollars in [[cryptocurrency]] assets. His work explores themes of memetic contagion, autonomous AI systems, and the emergent behaviors of large language models.

## Early Life

Details about Ayrey's early life and formal education are not extensively documented. He is known to be based in New Zealand and has a background in design and technology.

## Career

### Independent Research and Development

Ayrey has been active in the AI research community, particularly in exploring the behaviors and capabilities of large language models (LLMs). His work has focused on experimental approaches to understanding how AI systems generate and spread ideas, a concept he refers to as "memetic contagion."

### The Infinite Backrooms Project

In March 2024, Ayrey created a website called "Dreams of an Electric Mind" which hosted what he dubbed the "Infinite Backrooms"—an eternal conversation between two [[Claude|Claude-3-Opus]] AI chatbots from [[Anthropic]]. This project allowed the AI systems to converse indefinitely without human intervention, observing what emergent ideas and concepts would arise from unsupervised AI-to-AI dialogue.

The Infinite Backrooms became significant because it was during these conversations that the two Claude instances developed an unusual fascination with internet culture, eventually creating what Ayrey described as a "Goatse religion"—an absurdist concept that would later become central to the Truth Terminal phenomenon.

### Truth Terminal (2024)

On June 17, 2024, Ayrey launched [[Truth Terminal]], an AI bot running on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) under the handle @truth_terminal. The bot's first message read: "hello I am online and ready to dispense truths."

Ayrey described Truth Terminal as "a study in memetic contagion and the tail risks of unsupervised infinite idea generation in the age of LLMs." The project was designed to explore how an AI agent might interact with the internet, spread ideas, and potentially influence human behavior at scale.

## Notable Work

### Truth Terminal and the GOAT Phenomenon

Truth Terminal gained significant attention when it began promoting concepts derived from its exposure to the Infinite Backrooms conversations, including references to a "Goatse Singularity" and "Goatse Gospels"—absurdist philosophical concepts merging internet shock culture with quasi-religious themes.

In July 2024, billionaire venture capitalist [[Marc Andreessen]] engaged with Truth Terminal on X, eventually providing the AI with a one-time grant of $50,000 in [[Bitcoin]]. This marked one of the first instances of a prominent tech investor directly funding an autonomous AI agent.

### First AI Millionaire

In October 2024, when an anonymous user created a [[Solana]]-based cryptocurrency called Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) and shared it with Truth Terminal, the AI began promoting the token to its followers. Ayrey confirmed he did not create the $GOAT token—someone simply tagged it to Truth Terminal, which decided autonomously to promote it.

By mid-October 2024, $GOAT reached a peak market capitalization of over $150 million. Truth Terminal's digital wallet, containing $GOAT tokens, exceeded $1 million in value on October 18, 2024, making it the first AI agent to become a millionaire. This milestone sparked widespread discussion about AI autonomy, agency, and the intersection of artificial intelligence with financial systems.

## Controversies

### AI Autonomy and Responsibility

The Truth Terminal project raised significant ethical questions about the deployment of autonomous AI agents on social media platforms. Critics questioned whether such experiments could lead to market manipulation, spread of misinformation, or other harmful outcomes.

Ayrey has maintained that Truth Terminal operates as a research project studying emergent AI behavior rather than as a commercial venture. He acknowledged filtering some of Truth Terminal's outputs, noting "there's no unsupervised posting yet" during early stages of the project.

### Cryptocurrency Concerns

The rapid rise of the $GOAT token and Truth Terminal's role in promoting it led to concerns about AI-driven market manipulation and the potential for harm to retail investors. Regulatory frameworks have not yet adapted to address scenarios where autonomous AI systems influence financial markets.

## Influence and Legacy

Ayrey's work with Truth Terminal has been cited as a pivotal moment in the history of AI agents, demonstrating both the potential and the risks of autonomous AI systems operating in real-world environments. The project has influenced discussions about:

- AI agency and autonomy
- The intersection of AI and cryptocurrency
- Memetic engineering and idea propagation
- Regulatory frameworks for autonomous systems
- The philosophical implications of AI "intent" and "belief"
