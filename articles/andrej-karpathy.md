# Andrej Karpathy

**Andrej Karpathy** (born October 23, 1986) is a Slovak-American AI researcher and educator who has worked at the intersection of [[deep learning]], [[computer vision]], and [[natural language processing]]. A founding member of [[OpenAI]] and former director of AI at [[Tesla]], Karpathy has become one of the most influential AI educators, known for his accessible explanations of complex neural network concepts and his popular YouTube tutorials.

## Overview

Karpathy occupies a unique position in the AI world: a world-class researcher who is equally renowned as an educator. His Stanford course on convolutional neural networks became one of the university's largest classes, and his YouTube channel has helped millions understand the fundamentals of modern AI. In 2024, he founded [[Eureka Labs]], an AI education company, and coined the term "[[vibe coding]]" to describe AI-assisted programming. He was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in AI in 2024.

## Early Life and Education

Karpathy was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), on October 23, 1986. He moved with his family to Toronto at age 15. Before becoming known for AI research, Karpathy gained internet fame through his YouTube channel "badmephisto," where he posted Rubik's cube tutorials that have been used by famous speedcubers including [[Feliks Zemdegs]]. The channel has accumulated over 9 million views.

He completed his bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Physics at the [[University of Toronto]] in 2009, followed by a master's degree at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 2011, where he worked on physically simulated figures with advisor Michiel van de Panne.

Karpathy received his PhD from [[Stanford University]] in 2015 under the supervision of [[Fei-Fei Li]], focusing on the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision—specifically, deep learning models that connect images and text.

## Career

### Stanford and CS231n

At Stanford, Karpathy authored and was the primary instructor of CS 231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition—the first deep learning course at the university. The class grew from 150 students in 2015 to 750 in 2017, becoming one of Stanford's largest courses. The course materials have been widely shared online and helped train a generation of AI practitioners.

### OpenAI (2015-2017, 2023-2024)

Karpathy was a founding member of [[OpenAI]] in December 2015, serving as a research scientist until 2017. During this period, OpenAI was establishing itself as a leading AI research lab.

He returned to OpenAI in February 2023, working on AI development before departing again in February 2024.

### Tesla (2017-2022)

In June 2017, Karpathy joined [[Tesla]] as Senior Director of AI and Autopilot Vision, reporting directly to [[Elon Musk]]. In this role, he led the team developing the computer vision systems that power Tesla's [[Autopilot]] self-driving technology.

After taking a several-month sabbatical, Karpathy announced his departure from Tesla in July 2022. Musk called his work "an honor."

### Eureka Labs (2024-present)

In July 2024, Karpathy announced the founding of [[Eureka Labs]], an AI education company. The company's first product is LLM101n, a course teaching people to build AI systems from scratch, and his "Zero to Hero" series on LLM fundamentals has reached a wide audience. The company advocates for AI teaching assistants, though this approach has drawn criticism over data privacy concerns and the potential loss of personal connection between teachers and students.

### "Vibe Coding"

In February 2025, Karpathy coined the term "[[vibe coding]]" to describe the emerging practice of non-programmers creating applications and websites simply by typing natural language prompts to AI assistants. The term quickly gained currency in discussions about how AI is democratizing software development.

## Educational Contributions

Beyond his formal courses, Karpathy has become one of the most influential AI educators through his YouTube channel, where he posts detailed tutorials on building neural networks from scratch. His videos explain concepts like backpropagation, transformers, and language models in accessible terms, often implementing systems character by character or line by line.

Notable educational content includes:
- Neural Networks: Zero to Hero series
- Building GPT from scratch tutorials
- Explanations of transformer architectures
- LLM101n course through Eureka Labs
