# Sundar Pichai

**Pichai Sundararajan** (born June 10, 1972), known professionally as **Sundar Pichai**, is an Indian-American business executive serving as the [[Chief Executive Officer]] of [[Alphabet Inc.]] and its subsidiary [[Google]]. Rising from product manager to lead one of the world's most influential technology companies, Pichai has overseen Google's transformation from a search engine into a diversified technology conglomerate and guided its ambitious expansion into [[artificial intelligence]] through projects including [[Google Gemini|Gemini]].

## Early Life and Education

Pichai was born in [[Madurai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India, into a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] Hindu family. His mother, Lakshmi, worked as a [[stenographer]], while his father, Regunatha Pichai, was an [[electrical engineer]] at [[General Electric Company|GEC]], the British conglomerate, where he also managed a factory that manufactured electrical components.

Growing up in a modest two-room apartment in [[Chennai]], Pichai demonstrated exceptional memory—reportedly able to recall every phone number he had ever dialed. He completed his schooling at Jawahar Vidyalaya Senior Secondary School in [[Ashok Nagar, Chennai]] and finished Class XII at Vana Vani school at [[IIT Madras]].

Pichai earned his [[Bachelor of Technology]] in [[metallurgical engineering]] from [[IIT Kharagpur]], where he met his future wife, Anjali. He then pursued graduate studies in the United States, obtaining a [[Master of Science]] in [[materials science and engineering]] from [[Stanford University]], where he was named a Siebel Scholar, and an [[MBA]] from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named a Palmer Scholar.

## Career

### Early Career

Before joining Google, Pichai worked as a [[materials engineer]] at [[Applied Materials]] and subsequently in [[management consulting]] at [[McKinsey & Company]], gaining experience in engineering and business strategy that would prove valuable in his later leadership roles.

### Google (2004–Present)

Pichai joined Google in 2004 as a product manager, initially working on the Google Toolbar and eventually leading the development of [[Google Chrome]]. His advocacy for creating Google's own web browser was initially met with skepticism, but Chrome's 2008 launch proved transformative for both the company and the internet.

**Product Leadership**: Pichai's portfolio expanded rapidly. He oversaw the development of:
- [[Google Chrome]] – which became the world's dominant web browser
- [[ChromeOS]] – the operating system powering [[Chromebook]] devices
- [[Google Drive]] – cloud storage and collaboration platform
- Key improvements to [[Gmail]] and [[Google Maps]]

In November 2009, Pichai demonstrated Chrome OS publicly, with Chromebooks reaching consumers in 2012. In May 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the [[VP8]] video codec and introduced the [[WebM]] video format.

**Android Leadership**: In March 2013, Pichai took over management of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] from co-founder [[Andy Rubin]], consolidating control over Google's major computing platforms. His ability to manage Android alongside Chrome demonstrated his capacity for leadership at scale.

**CEO of Google**: On August 10, 2015, [[Larry Page]] announced a corporate restructuring that would create [[Alphabet Inc.]] as a holding company, with Pichai named CEO of Google, now a subsidiary. He had previously been appointed Product Chief and was widely seen as Page's successor.

### Alphabet Inc. (2019–Present)

In December 2019, Pichai's responsibilities expanded when he was named CEO of Alphabet Inc. following the departure of co-founders Larry Page and [[Sergey Brin]] from day-to-day operations. This made him responsible for the entire Alphabet portfolio, including [[Waymo]], [[Verily]], and other "moonshot" projects.

**AI Strategy and Gemini**: Under Pichai's leadership, Google made [[artificial intelligence]] central to its corporate strategy. The company developed and launched [[Google Gemini]], its family of multimodal AI models designed to compete with [[OpenAI]]'s [[GPT-4]] and other frontier models. Pichai has consistently emphasized AI as the most significant technological transformation since the mobile internet.

**Congressional Testimony**: On December 11, 2018, Pichai testified before the [[United States House Judiciary Committee]], addressing questions about alleged political bias, privacy practices, and plans for a "censored search app" in China. He assured lawmakers that Google employees cannot influence search results and that users can opt out of data collection.

**Workforce Challenges**: Pichai's tenure has included difficult decisions. In 2023, Google undertook large-scale layoffs that drew criticism, particularly given his $200 million compensation in 2022. In April 2024, following protests against [[Project Nimbus]] (Google's cloud contract with the Israeli government), Pichai stated that "the office is not a place to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics."

## Leadership Style

Colleagues describe Pichai as calm, measured, and consensus-building—qualities that helped him navigate Google's famously opinionated engineering culture. His rise was enabled partly by his reputation as a "company man" who could manage competing interests while maintaining focus on product excellence.

Notably, Pichai was considered a serious candidate for [[Microsoft]]'s CEO position in 2014, which ultimately went to [[Satya Nadella]]. Google reportedly offered significant retention incentives to keep him.

- **[[Asia Game Changer Award]]** (2021) – from the [[Asia Society]]

## Personal Life

Pichai married Anjali Haryani, whom he met while studying at IIT Kharagpur. She is originally from [[Kota, Rajasthan]]. The couple has two children and resides in [[Los Altos Hills, California]].

His recreational interests include [[cricket]] and [[association football|soccer]]. As of May 2025, his net worth is estimated at approximately $1.1 billion.
