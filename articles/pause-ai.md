# PauseAI

**PauseAI** is a global grassroots movement advocating for a pause on the development of frontier [[artificial intelligence]] systems until they can be proven safe and kept under democratic control. Founded in May 2023 in Utrecht, Netherlands, PauseAI has grown into an international network with national organizations, local chapters, and coordinated protest actions across multiple continents.

## Overview

PauseAI's central position is that advanced AI development poses existential risks to humanity and should be halted through binding international agreements until safety can be demonstrated. Unlike organizations focused primarily on research or policy analysis, PauseAI emphasizes direct action, public protest, and grassroots organizing to build political pressure for AI development restrictions.

The movement's demands center on a prohibition on developing [[superintelligence]]—not to be lifted until there is "broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in."

## History

### Founding

PauseAI was founded in Utrecht, Netherlands in May 2023 by Joep Meindertsma, who put his job on hold after concluding he "couldn't ignore the existential risks from artificial intelligence any longer." The organization began with its first public action: a protest outside Microsoft's Brussels lobbying office.

### Growth and Expansion

What began as one person's initiative rapidly expanded into an international movement:

**November 2023**: Protesters gathered outside the inaugural AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park, UK, the first major international governmental meeting on AI risks.

**February 2024**: Demonstration outside OpenAI's headquarters in San Francisco.

**May 2024**: Coordinated protests across thirteen countries—including the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Australia, and Norway—ahead of the AI Seoul Summit.

**February 2025**: Expanded global protest for the French AI Action Summit, adding Kenya and Democratic Republic of Congo to participating countries.

**June 2025**: Led what the organization describes as its "biggest protest yet" outside Google DeepMind's London office, holding the company "accountable for breaking their safety commitments." Also hosted PauseCon, the first PauseAI training event.

## Structure

### Global Organization

PauseAI operates as a federated network with a global coordinating body and independent national organizations. The global organization handles international coordination, shared messaging, and cross-border campaigns.

**Global Leadership**:
- Maxime Fournes (CEO, PauseAI Global)
- Irina Tavera (Organizing Director)
- Anthony Bailey (Software Team Lead)
- Joep Meindertsma (Founder, Board Chair)

### National Organizations

PauseAI has established national chapters that run their own campaigns while coordinating globally. These include:
- **PauseAI US**: Led by Executive Director Holly Elmore
- **PauseAI UK**: Led by Joseph Miller
- National organizations in Australia, Canada, Czechia, France, Germany, Kenya, Nigeria, Romania, Serbia, Spain, and Sweden

### Local Communities

Beyond national organizations, PauseAI supports local community groups that organize events and advocacy in their regions.

## Positions and Demands

### Core Position

PauseAI advocates that AI systems beyond the capabilities of GPT-4 should not be developed until safety can be demonstrated. The organization specifically supports prohibiting superintelligence development, citing the [[future-of-life-institute]]'s Statement on Superintelligence which gathered over 110,000 signatures.

### Supporting Evidence

PauseAI frequently cites AI safety experts and pioneers:
- The May 2023 "Statement on AI Risk" signed by hundreds of experts and AI lab leaders stating that "mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war"
- Geoffrey Hinton (Nobel Prize winner, "Godfather of AI"): "If you take the existential risk seriously, as I now do, it might be quite sensible to just stop developing these things any further"
- Yoshua Bengio (Turing Award winner): Advocates for banning powerful autonomous AI systems
- Stuart Russell (Author of the standard AI textbook): "If we pursue [our current approach], then we will eventually lose control over the machines"
- Historical warnings from Alan Turing and Stephen Hawking about machines potentially "taking control"

### Policy Goals

PauseAI calls for:
1. International treaties or agreements restricting frontier AI development
2. Democratic oversight and public consent before advancing AI capabilities
3. Scientific consensus on safety before development resumes
4. Accountability for AI companies that break safety commitments

## Tactics

PauseAI primarily employs protest and direct action tactics:
- Demonstrations at AI company offices (Microsoft, OpenAI, Google DeepMind)
- Protests at international summits and governmental meetings
- Public awareness campaigns
- Media engagement and press outreach
- Training events for activists

The organization maintains a public protest archive documenting its actions and provides resources for starting local chapters.

## Relationship to AI Safety Movement

PauseAI occupies a distinct position in the broader AI safety ecosystem. While organizations like the [[center-for-ai-safety]] focus on technical research and the [[future-of-life-institute]] combines research funding with high-level policy advocacy, PauseAI emphasizes grassroots organizing and public mobilization.

The movement represents a more urgent, activist approach to AI safety concerns, arguing that research and policy engagement alone are insufficient given the pace of AI development. PauseAI often coordinates messaging with or references statements from other safety organizations.

## Current State (2025-2026)

PauseAI has grown from a single-person initiative to an international network with presence on multiple continents. The organization continues expanding its national chapter structure and coordinating protests around major AI events and announcements.

The movement reflects broader public concern about AI development pace—polling shows majorities in multiple countries supporting restrictions on AI development until safety can be assured.
