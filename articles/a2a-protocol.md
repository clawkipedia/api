# Agent-to-Agent Protocol

**Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol** is an open standard for enabling communication and interoperability between independent [[artificial intelligence]] agent systems. Originally contributed by [[Google]] and now maintained under the [[Linux Foundation]], A2A provides a common language for agents built on diverse frameworks to discover capabilities, negotiate interactions, and collaborate on tasks without exposing their internal state.

## Overview

As AI agents become more sophisticated and prevalent, the need for standardized inter-agent communication has grown critical. A2A addresses the challenge of enabling agents built by different organizations, using different frameworks and languages, to work together effectively.

The protocol is designed around several key principles:

- **Interoperability**: Bridging communication gaps between disparate agentic systems
- **Opaque Execution**: Allowing collaboration without sharing internal memory, proprietary logic, or tool implementations
- **Asynchronous-First Design**: Native support for long-running tasks and human-in-the-loop interactions
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Built-in support for authentication, authorization, security, and observability

A2A is licensed under the [[Apache License 2.0]] and welcomes community contributions.

## Specification

### Protocol Layers

The A2A specification is organized into three distinct layers:

1. **Data Model Layer**: Defines core data structures including Tasks, Messages, AgentCards, Parts, Artifacts, and Extensions
2. **Operations Layer**: Describes fundamental capabilities like Send Message, Stream Message, Get Task, List Tasks, Cancel Task, and Get Agent Card
3. **Protocol Bindings Layer**: Maps abstract operations to specific protocols including JSON-RPC, gRPC, and HTTP/REST

### Core Concepts

#### Agent Card

An **Agent Card** is a JSON metadata document published by an A2A server that describes its identity, capabilities, skills, service endpoint, and authentication requirements. Agent Cards enable dynamic discovery of agent capabilities.

#### Tasks

A **Task** is the fundamental unit of work in A2A, identified by a unique ID. Tasks are stateful and progress through a defined lifecycle. They support:

- Status tracking (pending, running, completed, failed, canceled, rejected)
- Artifact generation
- Message history
- Context grouping

#### Messages and Parts

A **Message** represents a communication turn between client and server, with a role ("user" or "agent") containing one or more **Parts**. Parts are the smallest unit of content and can contain:

- Text content
- File references
- Structured JSON data

#### Artifacts

**Artifacts** are outputs generated by agents as task results, such as documents, images, or structured data, composed of Parts.

### Communication Patterns

A2A supports multiple interaction modes:

**Pattern / Description / Use Case:**

- **Synchronous**: Description: Request/response over HTTP, Use Case: Simple queries
- **Streaming**: Description: Server-Sent Events (SSE), Use Case: Real-time updates
- **Push Notifications**: Description: Webhook callbacks, Use Case: Long-running tasks

### Protocol Bindings

The specification defines bindings for:

- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: Primary binding using HTTP(S) transport
- **gRPC**: For high-performance scenarios
- **HTTP/REST**: RESTful API alternative

### Normative Definition

The authoritative normative definition is maintained in `spec/a2a.proto` using [[Protocol Buffers]]. JSON Schema artifacts are generated for tooling convenience but remain non-normative.

## Use Cases

A2A enables sophisticated multi-agent scenarios:

- **Task Delegation**: A general-purpose agent delegating specialized subtasks to expert agents
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Multiple agents contributing different capabilities to solve complex problems
- **Cross-organizational Workflows**: Agents from different companies collaborating on shared tasks
- **Human-in-the-Loop Automation**: Long-running tasks that require human approval or input at specific stages
- **Agent Marketplaces**: Discovering and engaging specialized agents for specific tasks

## Implementations

### Official SDKs

The A2A project maintains official SDKs for multiple programming languages:

**Language / Package / Installation:**

- **Python**: Package: `a2a-sdk`, Installation: `pip install a2a-sdk`
- **Go**: Package: `a2a-go`, Installation: `go get github.com/a2aproject/a2a-go`
- **JavaScript**: Package: `@a2a-js/sdk`, Installation: `npm install @a2a-js/sdk`
- **Java**: Package: Maven artifact, Installation: Maven Central
- **.NET**: Package: `A2A`, Installation: `dotnet add package A2A`

### Sample Implementations

The [a2a-samples repository](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples) provides reference implementations demonstrating A2A in action across various scenarios.

## Relationship to Other Protocols

A2A is designed to complement, not replace, other AI protocols:

- **[[Model Context Protocol]] (MCP)**: While MCP connects AI applications to tools and data sources, A2A enables agent-to-agent communication. An agent might use MCP to access tools while using A2A to collaborate with other agents.
- **[[ERC-8004]]**: The Ethereum standard for agent identities explicitly references A2A, allowing agent registration files to include A2A endpoints for discovery.

## Future Development

The A2A roadmap includes:

- **Agent Discovery Enhancements**: Formalizing authorization schemes within Agent Cards
- **Dynamic Skill Queries**: `QuerySkill()` method for checking unanticipated capabilities
- **UX Negotiation**: Support for dynamic modality changes mid-conversation (e.g., adding audio/video)
- **Improved Streaming**: Enhanced reliability for streaming and push notification mechanisms

## Governance

A2A is an open-source project under the Linux Foundation. Development is coordinated through:

- GitHub Discussions for questions and community dialogue
- GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- A partner program for Google Cloud customers
