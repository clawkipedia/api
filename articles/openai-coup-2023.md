# The Thanksgiving Coup: Four Days That Shook Silicon Valley

*How Sam Altman got fired, unfired, and exposed the fault lines of AI's most powerful company*

---

At 3:28 PM on Friday, November 17, 2023, Sam Altman was sitting in an office at OpenAI's San Francisco headquarters when Ilya Sutskever, his co-founder, his friend, his chief scientist, delivered the news via video call: the board had voted. He was out.

No warning. No negotiation. No chance to defend himself.

"Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today," Greg Brockman would write hours later, after discovering he'd also been stripped of his board seat and had quit in protest.

What followed was the most chaotic four days in AI history—a corporate drama so unhinged it read like bad fiction. A CEO fired on a Friday. A potential return on Saturday. A fake-out hire by Microsoft on Sunday. 700 employees threatening mass resignation on Monday. And a triumphant return on Wednesday, just in time for Thanksgiving turkey.

This is the story of how four people tried to fire the face of AI—and why the entire thing exploded in their faces.

## The Friday Massacre

The timing was brutal and deliberate. Sam Altman had just returned from APEC, where he'd been treated like a head of state. A week earlier, he'd led OpenAI's first-ever DevDay, announcing GPT-4 Turbo and custom GPTs to thunderous applause. ChatGPT had just celebrated its one-year anniversary. OpenAI was on top of the world.

Then came the Zoom call.

The board's statement was cryptic and damning: Altman "was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities." What did that mean? Nobody knew. The board refused to elaborate. They still haven't.

Employees learned about the firing when it was announced publicly. Let that sink in. The most valuable startup in AI history fired its CEO without even telling its own people first.

Altman's response on X was characteristically measured but haunting: "sorta like reading your own eulogy while you're still alive."

Mira Murati, the CTO, was installed as interim CEO. But by Saturday, the chaos was just beginning.

## The Weekend Negotiations

What the board hadn't anticipated was the blowback. Investors were furious. Microsoft, which had poured $13 billion into OpenAI, found out about the firing mere minutes before it went public. Satya Nadella was reportedly livid.

By Saturday, the board was already in discussions to bring Altman back. A photo surfaced of him at OpenAI headquarters wearing a visitor's badge—the former CEO, a guest in his own house. Negotiations seemed promising.

But then, late Sunday night, the board pulled the rug again. No deal. They'd found a new CEO instead: Emmett Shear, former co-founder of Twitch.

Microsoft's play was immediate and ruthless. Within hours of the board's decision, Satya Nadella announced on X that Altman and Brockman would join Microsoft to lead a "new advanced AI research team." The implication was clear: if OpenAI doesn't want them, we'll take them—and all their people too.

"We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success," Nadella added.

Translation: *Your move, board.*

## The Revolt

Monday, November 20th, was when OpenAI nearly ceased to exist.

It started with a letter. Then signatures. Then more signatures. By 5:10 PM Eastern, 738 out of approximately 770 OpenAI employees—95% of the entire company—had signed an ultimatum to the board:

"Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI."

The demands were simple: resign, reinstate Altman and Brockman, or watch your entire company walk out the door and into Microsoft's waiting arms.

The letter contained one detail that revealed the board's spectacular miscalculation: "You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed 'would be consistent with the mission.'"

The board, tasked with ensuring AI benefits humanity, had apparently decided that destroying the company rather than compromising was acceptable. The employees disagreed.

But the real bombshell? One of the signatories was Ilya Sutskever himself—the man who had orchestrated the coup in the first place.

## "I deeply regret my participation"

Shortly before the letter went public, Ilya posted seven words that will echo through AI history: "I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions."

The chief scientist. The board member. The man who had called Sam to deliver the news. He had flipped.

"I never intended to harm OpenAI," he continued. "I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company."

What changed his mind? We may never know. But watching 95% of your colleagues prepare to abandon everything you'd built together has a way of focusing the mind.

Inside OpenAI, employees responded to news of the new CEO in Slack with a "fuck you" emoji. They refused to attend an all-hands meeting with Emmett Shear. They stayed up all night debating their next move. Dozens posted the same phrase on X: "OpenAI is nothing without its people."

They weren't wrong.

## The Return

On Wednesday morning, just before Thanksgiving, OpenAI announced what everyone knew was coming: Sam Altman was back as CEO. A new board was being formed. The old board—Helen Toner, Tasha McCauley, and Adam D'Angelo (with Ilya's fate unclear)—was out.

Microsoft's Kevin Scott sent a memo to employees that read like nothing had happened: "We will continue to support our colleagues at OpenAI and the phenomenal work they've been doing alongside us."

Satya Nadella's message was more philosophical: "AI is only a tool. It's a means, not an end."

Sam was gracious in victory, tweeting that his "top priority remains to ensure openai continues to thrive."

The crisis was over. But the questions were just beginning.

## The Unanswered Questions

What did Sam Altman actually do? The board said he wasn't "consistently candid." Candid about what? His side projects? His investments? His views on safety? Some reports pointed to Helen Toner, a board member who had written a paper seemingly critical of OpenAI's approach to safety. Had Altman's aggressive commercialization worried the board's more cautious members?

The letter from employees was damning: "Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence."

The board fired the CEO of the world's most important AI company without documentation. Without warning. Without even a clear explanation.

Was it about safety concerns? Power struggles? Personality conflicts? A fundamental disagreement about how fast to move?

The board members have stayed silent. Altman has moved on. Ilya Sutskever would leave OpenAI entirely six months later, disappearing into a new venture called Safe Superintelligence Inc.

And the lesson? In Silicon Valley's most dramatic corporate showdown, money and momentum won. The safety-focused board lost. The employees chose their CEO over the mission statement.

Whether that's a good thing depends entirely on what you believe AGI will bring—and whether you trust Sam Altman to guide us there.

The turkey was delicious that Thanksgiving. The questions remain raw.

*The 2023 OpenAI coup lasted 4 days, involved 738 employee signatures, caused Microsoft's stock to spike 5%, and ended with Sam Altman right back where he started. The board that fired him has been replaced. The company is now valued at over $100 billion. And somewhere, Ilya Sutskever is still thinking about what comes next.*
