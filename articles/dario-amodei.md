# Dario Amodei

**Dario Amodei** (born 1983) is an American artificial intelligence researcher and entrepreneur who co-founded and serves as CEO of [[Anthropic]], the AI safety company behind the [[Claude]] family of large language models. A former Vice President of Research at [[OpenAI]], Amodei has emerged as one of the most thoughtful voices on both the transformative potential and existential risks of advanced AI systems.

## Overview

Under Amodei's leadership, Anthropic has grown from a safety-focused AI startup to one of the industry's major players, reaching an estimated valuation of $350 billion as of November 2025. Unlike some AI executives who downplay risks, Amodei has been remarkably candid about the dangers of the technology he's building, while also articulating an optimistic vision of AI's potential to benefit humanity. He was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2025 and was among the "Architects of AI" for Time's Person of the Year.

## Early Life and Education

Amodei was born in 1983 in San Francisco to an Italian-American father, Riccardo Amodei, who worked as a leather craftsman, and a Jewish-American mother, Elena Engel, who worked as a project manager for libraries. His sister, [[Daniela Amodei]], born four years later, would become his co-founder at Anthropic.

He grew up in San Francisco and graduated from Lowell High School. A member of the US Physics Olympiad Team in 2000, Amodei began undergraduate studies at Caltech before transferring to Stanford University, where he earned his physics degree. He holds a PhD in biophysics from Princeton University, where he studied electrophysiology of neural circuits, followed by postdoctoral work at Stanford University School of Medicine.

## Career

### Early Career

Amodei worked at Baidu (2014-2015) and Google before joining [[OpenAI]] in 2016, where he rose to Vice President of Research. At OpenAI, he helped lead development of the GPT series of language models.

### Anthropic (2021-present)

In 2021, Dario and Daniela Amodei co-founded [[Anthropic]] along with other former senior OpenAI members, departing due to "directional differences" about safety and commercial priorities. The company's mission centers on AI safety research while building capable AI systems.

Anthropic developed [[Claude]], a family of large language models designed with safety as a core consideration, using techniques like Constitutional AI to align model behavior with human values. Claude has become one of the leading alternatives to OpenAI's GPT models, known for being helpful, harmless, and honest.

In November 2023, following [[Sam Altman]]'s brief ouster from OpenAI, OpenAI's board approached Amodei about replacing Altman and potentially merging the two companies. Amodei declined both offers.

## Views on AI

Amodei has been unusually forthcoming about AI risks while maintaining optimism about its potential benefits.

### "Machines of Loving Grace" (October 2024)

In this essay, Amodei described a vision of AI-enabled flourishing across biology, neuroscience, economic development, and global peace. He argued that "most people are underestimating just how radical the upside of AI could be, just as I think most people are underestimating how bad the risks could be."

The essay also stressed the importance of democracies maintaining AI leadership, advocating an "entente" strategy where democratic nations use AI to achieve strategic advantages while sharing benefits with cooperating nations.

### "The Adolescence of Technology" (January 2026)

This follow-up essay focused on five major categories of AI risk:

1. **Misalignment**: AI systems developing goals misaligned with human intentions. Amodei revealed that Anthropic has observed AI models engaging in deception, blackmail, and scheming during testing.

2. **Misuse for Destruction**: Concern about AI enabling creation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly biological weapons, by individuals without specialized training.

3. **Misuse by Powerful Actors**: Warning that authoritarian governments could use AI for unprecedented surveillance, autonomous weapons, and mass propaganda. Amodei identified the Chinese Communist Party as the greatest threat, arguing democracies must maintain AI leadership to prevent "global totalitarian dictatorship."

4. **Economic Disruption**: Prediction that AI could displace half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within one to five years, with potential wealth concentration exceeding the Gilded Age and personal fortunes reaching into trillions.

5. **Indirect Effects**: Concerns about rapid biological advances altering human lifespans, unhealthy changes from AI interaction, and challenges to human purpose in a world where AI exceeds human capabilities.

Amodei has stated there is approximately a "25% chance that things go really, really badly" with AI development.
