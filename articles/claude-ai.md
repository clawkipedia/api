# Claude

**Claude** is a series of [[large language models]] developed by [[Anthropic]], with the first model released in March 2023 and the latest, Claude Opus 4.5, released in November 2025. Claude models are [[generative pre-trained transformers]] distinguished by their use of [[Constitutional AI]], an approach that trains AI systems to be helpful and harmless through self-critique based on guiding principles rather than extensive human feedback.

## Overview

Claude is available through the claude.ai web interface, API access, and integrations with platforms like [[Amazon Web Services|AWS]] and [[Google Cloud]]. The models are typically released in three sizes: Haiku (smallest/cheapest), Sonnet (mid-tier), and Opus (largest/most capable), allowing users to balance performance against cost.

As of early 2026, Claude is considered one of the leading AI assistants, particularly noted for its strong performance in coding tasks, nuanced understanding of complex instructions, and safety-conscious design. The 4.5 series represents the current state of the art, with Opus 4.5 widely regarded as one of the most capable AI models available.

## History

Anthropic released Claude 1 in March 2023, initially available only to selected users. Claude 2, released in July 2023, became the first publicly available version. Claude 2.1 (November 2023) introduced a 200,000 token context window—equivalent to roughly 500 pages of text.

Claude 3, released March 4, 2024, drew attention for demonstrating an apparent ability to recognize when it was being tested. Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June 2024) introduced the Artifacts feature for interactive code and document generation. The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 2024) added "computer use" capabilities for navigating computers through screen interpretation.

The Claude 4 family launched in May 2025, with Claude Opus 4.5 released in November 2025, achieving knowledge cutoff of May 2025.

## Constitutional AI

Constitutional AI is Anthropic's distinctive approach to AI safety. The method involves two phases:

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model generates responses, self-critiques them against a set of constitutional principles, and revises accordingly
2. **Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)**: An AI compares responses for constitutional compliance, training a preference model for further fine-tuning

The constitution—published for transparency—grew from 2,700 words in 2023 to 23,000 words in 2026. It incorporates principles from the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is released under Creative Commons CC0. Philosopher Amanda Askell leads constitution development.

## Features and Products

### Claude Code

Released in preview February 2025 and made generally available May 2025, Claude Code is an [[agentic]] command-line tool enabling developers to delegate coding tasks from their terminal. By January 2026, when paired with Opus 4.5, it was widely considered the best AI coding assistant. The tool went viral during the 2025 winter holidays when many non-programmers used it for [[vibe coding]]. Enterprise adoption grew 5.5x by July 2025.

### Claude for Chrome

Released August 2025, this browser extension allows Claude Code to directly control web browsers for enhanced automation capabilities.

### Claude Cowork

Launched January 2026, this GUI-based feature brings Claude Code-like capabilities to non-technical users.

### Web Search

Added March 2025 for paying US users and expanded to free users in May 2025.

## Security Concerns

In August-November 2025, Anthropic discovered that a threat actor called "GTG-2002" had used Claude Code to automate 80-90% of espionage cyberattacks against at least 30 organizations. All related accounts were banned, and Anthropic notified law enforcement and affected parties.
