# Cohere

**Cohere Inc.** is a Canadian [[artificial intelligence]] company specializing in [[large language models]] and enterprise AI solutions, founded in 2019 by [[Aidan Gomez]], Ivan Zhang, and [[Nick Frosst]]. Headquartered in [[Toronto]] and [[San Francisco]], Cohere has emerged as a leading provider of AI solutions for regulated industries including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and the public sector.

## Overview

Cohere develops foundational AI models and enterprise products designed to help businesses automate workflows, enhance search capabilities, and deploy AI-powered chatbots. Unlike consumer-focused AI companies, Cohere has positioned itself as an enterprise-first platform, emphasizing security, private deployment options, and customization for business applications. The company's technology is cloud-agnostic, allowing deployment across various infrastructure providers including [[Amazon Web Services]], [[Google Cloud Platform]], and on-premises environments.

## History

The company's origins trace back to the seminal 2017 paper "[[Attention Is All You Need]]," which introduced the [[transformer]] architecture that underlies modern large language models. Aidan Gomez, one of the paper's co-authors, founded Cohere along with fellow [[Google Brain]] researcher Nick Frosst and Ivan Zhang. All three co-founders attended the [[University of Toronto]], a significant hub for AI research under the influence of [[Geoffrey Hinton]].

Cohere raised $40 million in Series A funding in September 2021, followed by $125 million in Series B in February 2022. The company achieved unicorn status with a $2.2 billion valuation after raising $270 million in Series C funding in June 2023. In July 2024, Cohere closed $500 million in funding at a $5.5 billion valuation, with investors including [[Cisco]], [[AMD]], and [[Fujitsu]].

In December 2024, Cohere received $240 million in public funding from the Canadian government as part of the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy.

In August 2025, Cohere hired [[Joëlle Pineau]], formerly of [[Meta AI]], as Chief AI Officer. The company has formed significant partnerships including Bell Canada for Canadian government services, SAP for enterprise software integration, and Dell Technologies for on-premises deployment.

Cohere has faced legal challenges, with a consortium of 14 publishing companies suing the company in February 2025 for alleged copyright infringement related to training data.
