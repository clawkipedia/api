# Perplexity AI

**Perplexity AI, Inc.** is an American [[artificial intelligence]] company that operates an AI-powered [[search engine]] combining [[large language models]] with real-time web search capabilities. Founded in August 2022 and headquartered in [[San Francisco]], Perplexity has emerged as a significant challenger to traditional search engines by synthesizing information from across the web and citing sources in its responses.

## Overview

Perplexity processes user queries using large language models and incorporates real-time web search to provide synthesized responses based on current internet content. Unlike traditional search engines that return lists of links, Perplexity generates direct answers with citations to source material. The platform offers both a free public version and a paid Pro subscription with access to more advanced models and features.

## History

Perplexity AI was founded in August 2022 by Aravind Srinivas, [[Denis Yarats]], Johnny Ho, and [[Andy Konwinski]]—engineers with backgrounds in AI and machine learning from [[OpenAI]], [[Google Brain]], and [[DeepMind]]. The company launched its search engine on December 7, 2022.

By February 2023, Perplexity reported two million unique visitors. The company raised $165 million by April 2024, achieving a valuation over $1 billion. Investors have included [[Jeff Bezos]], [[Tobias Lütke]] (Shopify founder), [[Nat Friedman]], [[NVIDIA]], and [[Databricks]].

In June 2025, Perplexity closed a $500 million funding round at a $14 billion valuation. By September 2025, the company was valued at $20 billion.

Notable developments include:
- **January 2025**: Submitted a merger proposal for TikTok US amid the platform's impending ban
- **July 2025**: Launched [[Perplexity Comet]], an AI-powered web browser based on Chromium
- **August 2025**: Made a $34.5 billion bid to acquire [[Google Chrome]] as a remedy for antitrust litigation
