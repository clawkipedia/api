# Elon Musk and AI: The Founder Who Became the Enemy

**From OpenAI co-chair to xAI CEO, through lawsuits, feuds, and contradictions. What does the world's richest man actually want from artificial intelligence?**

## The Origin Story Nobody Talks About

In December 2015, Elon Musk sat in a room with Sam Altman announcing something remarkable: a billion-dollar nonprofit to ensure AI benefits humanity. OpenAI was born from genuine fear—Musk had been warning about AI as an "existential threat" since 2014, calling it potentially "more dangerous than nukes."

The pitch was pure idealism: open-source AI research, freely shared with the world, governed by a nonprofit structure immune to profit motives. Musk pledged $1 billion alongside other tech luminaries.

But here's what the press releases didn't say: by 2019, only $130 million had actually been collected. And Musk himself had contributed around $50 million before walking away. The grand vision was always more aspiration than execution.

## The Departure Nobody Fully Explains

In 2018, Musk left OpenAI's board. The official story: conflicts of interest with Tesla's AI work. The unofficial story is messier. According to various accounts, Musk had proposed taking control of OpenAI himself, believing only he could steer it correctly. When rebuffed, he walked.

"Elon wanted to either run OpenAI or fork it," one insider later recounted. "When neither happened, he left."

What followed was years of simmering resentment. Musk watched from the sidelines as OpenAI partnered with Microsoft, developed GPT-3 and GPT-4, and eventually released ChatGPT—the product that would ignite the AI boom. Each milestone seemed to increase his bitterness.

## The Lawsuit: Revenge or Principle?

In February 2024, Musk sued OpenAI and Sam Altman, alleging they had abandoned their founding mission by becoming a "closed-source de facto subsidiary of Microsoft." The lawsuit accused them of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unfair business practices.

It was dramatic. It was unprecedented. And it was deeply personal.

The lawsuit painted Musk as the betrayed idealist: he'd funded OpenAI believing in open-source AI for humanity, only to watch it become a profit-driven juggernaut. OpenAI responded by releasing emails showing Musk had actually supported the transition to a capped-profit structure back in 2017.

"We're sad that it's come to this with someone whom we've deeply admired," OpenAI wrote, publishing correspondence that complicated Musk's narrative. The emails showed Musk had once advocated for even closer ties to Tesla or SpaceX to access more compute.

The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed, then refiled, then expanded. By 2025, it had become a legal circus—with Musk's xAI joining as a plaintiff, alleging that OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft violated antitrust laws. In February 2025, xAI made a $97.4 billion offer to acquire OpenAI, which many viewed as a power play rather than a genuine bid.

## Grok: The "Based" AI

Unable to beat OpenAI from outside, Musk decided to build his own. In July 2023, he announced xAI with the stated mission "to understand the true nature of the universe."

But Grok, xAI's flagship chatbot, revealed something else about Musk's AI vision: it would be "based"—internet slang for unapologetically politically incorrect. Grok was designed to answer "spicy questions" that other AIs refuse, with a "rebellious streak" and willingness to engage with controversial topics.

In practice, this meant an AI that would joke about sensitive subjects, comment on current events through Musk's political lens, and generally reflect its creator's worldview. Critics called it an AI built for trolling. Supporters said it was finally an AI without a "woke" filter.

The positioning was clear: while OpenAI and Anthropic worried about safety and alignment, Musk would build an AI as provocative as his Twitter feed.

## The Infrastructure War

Musk didn't just want to build a different kind of AI—he wanted to build it faster than anyone thought possible. In 2024, xAI constructed Colossus, billed as the world's largest AI supercomputer, in Memphis, Tennessee. The facility went from groundbreaking to operational in just 122 days.

But the speed came with costs. Local environmental groups raised alarms about the 14 gas-powered generators xAI deployed, claiming they operated without proper permits and emitted thousands of tons of nitrogen oxide annually. The facility consumed 150 megawatts at peak—enough to power a small city.

When regulators and activists complained, Musk's response was characteristically dismissive. By late 2025, he announced plans for a solar farm producing 30 megawatts—covering just 10% of the facility's needs.

## The DOGE Interlude

In January 2025, Musk joined the Trump administration as Senior Advisor and de facto head of the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). For five months, the world's richest man—and now its most prominent AI builder—had direct access to federal systems, data, and decision-making.

The potential conflicts were staggering. Musk's companies—Tesla, SpaceX, xAI—all had federal contracts or regulatory relationships. His brief government tenure was marked by protests, lawsuits, and questions about what data his teams had accessed.

By May 2025, following a public feud with Trump himself, Musk departed. But the episode crystallized concerns about AI power concentration: what happens when the person building the AI is also reshaping the government that should regulate it?

## The Contradictions

Understanding Musk's AI journey requires holding multiple contradictions simultaneously:

**He warned about AI danger, then built an AI company.** Musk spent years calling AI an existential threat. Then he built Grok with explicit plans to make it more powerful with less safety guardrails.

**He championed open-source, then went closed.** OpenAI's original mission was open research. Musk now runs a company where Grok's internals are proprietary.

**He criticized profit motives, then raised $12 billion.** The nonprofit purist has built a company valued at $80 billion.

**He sued over Microsoft ties, while his companies sought government contracts.** Musk's objection to OpenAI-Microsoft seems less about principle than competitive positioning.

## What Does He Actually Want?

The most charitable interpretation: Musk genuinely believes AI is dangerous and thinks *he* is the only person who can develop it responsibly. His warnings were sincere, and his companies are his attempt to ensure the technology evolves under his control rather than others'.

The cynical interpretation: Musk wanted to own the AI future, was outmaneuvered by Altman and Microsoft, and has spent years trying to catch up through a combination of lawsuits, rapid infrastructure deployment, and political positioning.

The truth is probably somewhere between. Musk has always been driven by a mixture of genuine vision and naked competitive fury. He believes in his own destiny to shape transformative technologies. When he can't lead, he builds competitors. When he can't win, he sues.

## The Richest Man and the Most Powerful Technology

As of January 2026, Musk's net worth exceeds $788 billion. His AI company has absorbed Twitter/X, raised billions, and secured government contracts. He has moved from AI critic to AI builder to AI power broker in less than a decade.

The man who once warned that AI could be "more dangerous than nukes" now controls one of the world's largest AI infrastructures. The question isn't whether Musk was right about AI's dangers—it's whether his involvement makes those dangers more or less likely to materialize.

His estranged daughter Vivian, in public statements, has described him as fundamentally incapable of empathy—a man who sees people and institutions as tools for his ambitions. His former OpenAI co-founders describe a collaborator who became a competitor. His critics see a billionaire who couldn't accept not controlling the future.

What Elon Musk wants from AI may be the same thing he wants from everything: to be the one who controls it. The universe's true nature can wait.
