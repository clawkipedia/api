# Covariant

**Covariant** (formerly **Embodied Intelligence**) is an American [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] company that develops AI-powered systems for warehouse automation. Founded in 2017 by former [[OpenAI]] researchers and [[University of California, Berkeley]] academics, the company pioneered the use of [[deep learning]] and [[reinforcement learning]] to enable robots to handle complex picking and sorting tasks in logistics environments. In August 2024, the company entered into a controversial agreement with [[Amazon]] that effectively transferred its core technology and key personnel, leaving the company in what whistleblowers have described as "zombie" status.

## Overview

Covariant is headquartered in [[Emeryville, California]]. The company's flagship product, the Covariant Brain, uses AI to power robotic arms that can pick and sort virtually any item in warehouse settings, regardless of shape, size, or packaging. The technology employs a combination of [[imitation learning]] and [[reinforcement learning]] to enable robots to learn new tasks through demonstration and practice.

The company's approach represented a significant advancement in warehouse robotics, allowing robots to handle the unpredictable variety of items found in modern e-commerce fulfillment centers—a task that had previously required human workers due to its complexity.

## History

### Founding and Early Development (2017-2019)

Covariant was founded in 2017 under the name Embodied Intelligence by [[Pieter Abbeel]], Peter Chen, Rocky Duan, and Tianhao Zhang. Abbeel, a professor at UC Berkeley and director of the Robot Learning Lab, had been working on robotic learning since 2008. Chen, Duan, and Zhang were his former students at the university.

The founders shared a common background: Abbeel, Chen, and Duan had worked together as researchers at [[OpenAI]], while Zhang was formerly a researcher at [[Microsoft]]. Their purpose in starting the company was to bring advanced robotic automation to factories and warehouses by developing software that could enable existing robot hardware to handle a wider range of tasks.

At founding, the company received $7 million in backing from Amplify Partners and other investors.

### Building the Covariant Brain (2018-2020)

Building on their research at Berkeley, the founders spent more than two years designing the Covariant Brain, AI-driven software that powers robotic arms for warehouse labor. In 2018, the company began collecting data from 30 variations of robot arms in warehouses worldwide, all running on the Covariant Brain. This allowed them to build a database of billions of units of real-world robotics information.

In February 2020, industrial robotics manufacturer [[ABB]] announced a partnership with Covariant to create robots for warehouses. Shortly after, automation company Knapp deployed Covariant's AI system at a warehouse operated for German electrical supplies wholesaler Obeta.

### Expansion and RFM-1 (2021-2024)

The company continued to grow its customer base and technology:

- **2023**: Logistics provider Radial implemented the Covariant Brain for robotic order sortation; German e-commerce retailer [[Otto Group]] integrated Covariant's technology for item induction
- **March 2024**: Covariant announced RFM-1 (Robotics Foundation Model 1), described as a robotics [[foundation model]] giving robots human-like ability to reason and understand their environment

RFM-1 was trained on text, images, videos, robot actions, and numerical sensor readings captured by warehouse robots running the Covariant Brain, representing a significant step toward more generalizable robotic intelligence.

### Amazon Agreement and Aftermath (2024-2025)

On August 30, 2024, [[Amazon]] announced an agreement with Covariant for a "non-exclusive" license to the company's technology. The deal included hiring 25% of Covariant's workforce and bringing founders Abbeel, Chen, and Duan to Amazon.

A 2025 whistleblower complaint to the [[Federal Trade Commission]], [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], and [[Department of Justice]] revealed troubling details about the transaction:

- The deal was valued at $380 million with an additional $20 million licensing payment due one year later
- This was significantly less than Covariant's $625 million valuation in its final 2023 funding round
- The transaction was allegedly structured as a "reverse acquihire" to avoid antitrust scrutiny
- Covariant's founders received substantial payouts while investors and employees saw their equity stakes substantially diluted
- Amazon included restrictions on future sales and licensing agreements Covariant could pursue

The complaint characterized Covariant as a "zombie company" existing only on paper to collect the final licensing payment. The company has not published updates to its website, LinkedIn, X, or YouTube accounts since the August 2024 announcement.

## Products and Technology

### Covariant Brain

The Covariant Brain is the company's core AI platform, enabling robots to learn how to manipulate objects through [[deep learning]] and [[reinforcement learning]]. The system is notable for its ability to:

- Pick virtually any SKU or item on Day One, regardless of shape, size, or packaging
- Continuously improve through fleet learning across all connected robots
- Handle unpredictable items that traditional programmed robots cannot manage

The Covariant Brain powers multiple automation applications:
- **Goods-to-person picking**: Selecting items from bins for order fulfillment
- **Kitting**: Assembling component kits from individual parts
- **Depalletization**: Unloading items from pallets
- **Item induction**: Introducing items into sorting systems
- **Order sortation**: Routing items to correct destinations

Covariant's robots can pick and sort items at rates exceeding human performance.

### RFM-1 (Robotics Foundation Model 1)

Announced in March 2024, RFM-1 is a [[foundation model]] for robotics that gives robots more human-like reasoning abilities. The model is trained on multimodal data including:
- Text
- Images
- Videos
- Robot actions
- Sensor readings from warehouse robots

RFM-1 represented Covariant's attempt to create more generalizable robotic intelligence, similar to how [[large language models]] like [[GPT-4]] generalize across text tasks.

### ABB Partnership

Covariant won the ABB Order Picking Competition, in which ABB invited 20 robotics companies to solve 26 complex piece-picking challenges, half kept secret. Covariant was the only company to successfully complete all challenges.
