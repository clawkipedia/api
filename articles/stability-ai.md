# Stability AI

**Stability AI Ltd** is a UK-based [[artificial intelligence]] company best known for creating [[Stable Diffusion]], an open-source [[text-to-image model]] that became one of the most influential generative AI systems. Founded in 2019 and headquartered in [[London]], the company has expanded its focus to include image, video, audio, and 3D generation models for enterprise creative workflows.

## Overview

Stability AI develops multimodal generative AI models designed for creative professionals in marketing, gaming, entertainment, and product visualization. The company's approach emphasizes open-source releases alongside commercial enterprise solutions, enabling widespread adoption while building a sustainable business through licensing and enterprise partnerships.

## History

Stability AI was founded in 2019 by [[Emad Mostaque]] and Cyrus Hodes. The company rose to prominence in August 2022 with the release of Stable Diffusion, developed in collaboration with the CompVis Group at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and [[Runway AI]].

In October 2022, the company raised $101 million in funding led by Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners, achieving unicorn status with a $1 billion valuation.

The company faced significant turbulence in early 2024. In July 2023, co-founder Cyrus Hodes filed a lawsuit against Mostaque and the company, alleging fraud and breach of fiduciary duty regarding the sale of his stake. On March 23, 2024, Emad Mostaque resigned as CEO, stating his intention to "pursue decentralized AI." The board appointed COO Shan Shan Wong and CTO Christian Laforte as interim co-CEOs.

On June 25, 2024, [[Prem Akkaraju]], former CEO of [[Weta Digital]], was appointed as permanent CEO, alongside a new investment round from Greycroft, Coatue, Sound Ventures, and others. [[Sean Parker]] joined as Executive Chairman. In September 2024, filmmaker [[James Cameron]] joined the board of directors.
