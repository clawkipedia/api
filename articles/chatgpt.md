# ChatGPT

**ChatGPT** is a [[generative artificial intelligence]] [[chatbot]] developed by [[OpenAI]], released in November 2022. Built on the [[GPT]] family of [[large language models]], ChatGPT uses [[generative pre-trained transformers]] to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts. It is widely credited with accelerating the [[AI boom]] and became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, reaching 100 million users within two months of launch.

## Overview

ChatGPT represents a breakthrough in conversational AI, enabling users to interact with an AI assistant through natural language text, voice, and image inputs. The service operates on a [[freemium]] model, with free access to basic features and paid subscription tiers offering enhanced capabilities. As of early 2026, ChatGPT's website ranks among the top 5 most-visited websites globally, demonstrating its massive cultural and commercial impact.

The chatbot can perform a wide variety of tasks including writing and debugging code, composing music and essays, answering questions, translation, summarization, and even simulating interactive environments like a Linux terminal or text-based games. Its versatility has made it a transformative tool across numerous professional fields, from education to software development.

## History

OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, initially based on fine-tuned versions of GPT-3.5. The company had been developing GPT models since 2018, with GPT-3 (175 billion parameters) released in 2020. ChatGPT represented a significant step forward in making these models accessible and useful for conversational applications.

In February 2023, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Plus, a premium subscription at $20/month, followed by Team and Enterprise tiers. The December 2024 release of the [[o1]] reasoning model coincided with the introduction of a Pro tier at $200/month. By August 2025, ChatGPT Go was offered in India at ₹399/month.

Mobile apps for iOS and Android launched in 2023, followed by a Windows desktop app in October 2024. ChatGPT can now serve as Android's default assistant.

## Technology

ChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that have been [[fine-tuning|fine-tuned]] for conversational assistance using two key approaches: [[supervised learning]] and [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF). Human trainers played both user and assistant roles during supervised learning, while the reinforcement learning phase involved trainers ranking model responses to create reward models.

As of early 2026, ChatGPT runs on GPT-5.2, representing multiple generations of advancement since launch. The underlying infrastructure initially used Microsoft Azure with thousands of [[Nvidia]] GPUs, with estimates suggesting 30,000 GPUs powered ChatGPT in 2023.

## Features

Key features include:

- **ChatGPT Search**: Deployed in late 2024, enabling web search for more accurate, up-to-date responses
- **Plugins**: Support for both OpenAI and third-party integrations including [[Expedia]], [[Wolfram]], [[Shopify]], and [[Slack]]
- **Memory**: Optional feature allowing ChatGPT to memorize specific information and recall old conversations
- **Pulse**: Added September 2025, generates daily analysis of user chats and connected apps like Gmail and Google Calendar
- **ChatGPT Atlas**: Launched October 2025, a browser integrating ChatGPT with "agentic mode" for automated online actions

## Impact and Criticism

ChatGPT has been praised for its potential to transform professional fields and has sparked significant public debate about creativity and the future of [[knowledge work]]. However, it faces criticism for several limitations:

- **Hallucinations**: Generation of plausible-sounding but incorrect information
- **Algorithmic bias**: Biases in training data reflected in responses
- **Misuse potential**: Facilitating academic dishonesty, misinformation, and malicious code generation
- **Copyright concerns**: Ethical questions around using copyrighted content for training

The service requires significant computing resources, with researchers estimating that 5-50 prompts need approximately 0.5 liters of water for server cooling.
