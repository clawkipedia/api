# Code Red: How ChatGPT Broke Google's Brain

*The search giant had invented the technology. Then it watched someone else eat its lunch.*

---

In early December 2022, Google executives gathered to watch a demonstration of ChatGPT, the AI chatbot that had taken the internet by storm. What they saw reportedly triggered a "code red" across the company—an all-hands-on-deck emergency response typically reserved for existential threats.

For a company that had declared itself "AI-first" since 2016, that had published the foundational Transformer paper that made ChatGPT possible, that employed some of the world's best AI researchers at DeepMind—this was humiliating.

Google had invented the car. OpenAI was winning the race.

What followed was two years of panic, embarrassment, and increasingly desperate attempts to catch up. This is the story of how the world's most powerful tech company fumbled its greatest innovation—and what happened when it tried to recover.

## The Irony

The cruel joke at the heart of Google's AI crisis is that Google created the technology that was disrupting Google.

In 2017, Google researchers published "Attention Is All You Need," the paper that introduced the Transformer architecture. This wasn't incremental progress—it was a fundamental breakthrough that enabled everything that followed: GPT, BERT, LLaMA, and virtually every other large language model.

Google had Transformers. Google had TPUs, purpose-built AI chips far ahead of the competition. Google had the data—years of search queries, Gmail messages, YouTube videos, the entire indexed web. Google had DeepMind, arguably the most prestigious AI research lab in the world.

And yet, when ChatGPT launched on November 30, 2022, Google was caught flat-footed.

The company had built LaMDA, a conversational AI that one engineer infamously claimed was sentient (it wasn't). It had built PaLM, a powerful language model. But it hadn't shipped any of this to consumers. It hadn't captured the public imagination. It hadn't done what OpenAI did: just... release the thing.

The reasons were cultural and institutional. Google was terrified of reputational risk. A chatbot that hallucinated? A model that said something racist? An AI that told users something dangerous? These weren't acceptable risks for a company whose search engine was used by billions.

So Google waited. And OpenAI didn't.

## The Emergency Response

After ChatGPT's launch, Sundar Pichai reportedly held meetings that disrupted the vacation schedules of Google's most senior executives. Teams across the company were redirected to AI. Projects were accelerated. Resources were reallocated.

The message was clear: this was an emergency.

Google's initial response was to announce Bard, its ChatGPT competitor, in February 2023. The reveal was supposed to demonstrate that Google could compete, that it hadn't been asleep at the wheel, that the AI-first company was still first in AI.

Instead, it demonstrated the opposite.

## The Bard Disaster

In Google's promotional materials, Bard was asked: "What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?"

Bard's response included this claim: the telescope "took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system."

This was, to use a technical term, completely wrong.

The first image of an exoplanet was taken in 2004, as NASA's own website clearly states. The James Webb Space Telescope launched in 2021. Astronomers immediately noticed the error and called it out on Twitter.

"Not to be a ~well, actually~ jerk, and I'm sure Bard will be impressive," tweeted astrophysicist Grant Tremblay, "but for the record: JWST did not take 'the very first image of a planet outside our solar system.'"

The gaffe wiped $100 billion off Google's market cap in a single day. The stock dropped 7%. The company that defined internet search had just demonstrated, in spectacular fashion, that its AI didn't know how to search for basic facts.

A Google spokesperson responded with corporate damage control: "This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we're kicking off this week with our Trusted Tester program."

Translation: We should have tested this more before embarrassing ourselves in front of the entire world.

## The Gemini Gambit

After the Bard debacle, Google needed a win. In December 2023, they thought they had one: Gemini, the company's most advanced AI model, the system they hoped would finally beat GPT-4.

The launch was a massive marketing push. CEO Sundar Pichai called it "the beginning of a new era of AI at Google: the Gemini era." DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis claimed Gemini beat GPT-4 on 30 out of 32 benchmarks. Google's stock jumped 5% on the announcement.

And then people actually looked at the promotional video.

Titled "Hands-on with Gemini: Interacting with multimodal AI," the demo showed Gemini responding in real-time to visual prompts—recognizing drawings, interpreting gestures, engaging in fluid conversation. It was jaw-dropping.

It was also fake.

AI experts quickly noticed that the video wasn't showing real-time interaction at all. The "responses" were generated from carefully curated still images, not live video. The voice wasn't Gemini speaking—it was text-to-speech over pre-written answers. The seamless, magical interaction depicted in the promotional material didn't actually work that way.

"That demo was incredibly edited to suggest that Gemini is far more capable than it is," tweeted pioneering software engineer Grady Booch. "You've been deceived, Chris. And shame on them for so doing."

Google eventually acknowledged the video was "illustrative"—a corporate term for "we fudged it." The promotional page that accompanied the video was more honest about Gemini's actual capabilities. But by then, the damage was done.

The company that had built its reputation on organizing the world's information had just released promotional material that was, charitably, misleading.

## The Deeper Problem

Google's AI struggles aren't just about bad demos or embarrassing errors. They reflect a fundamental challenge: how do you innovate when you have everything to lose?

OpenAI was a startup with nothing to protect. If ChatGPT hallucinated, who cared? They'd fix it in the next version. Move fast and break things—the old Facebook motto that Google itself had largely abandoned.

Google, by contrast, has 4.3 billion users depending on Search. It has Gmail, Google Docs, Android, Chrome, YouTube. It has a brand synonymous with reliable information. It has regulatory scrutiny that would make most companies weep.

Releasing an AI that makes things up? That's not "moving fast and breaking things." That's breaking trust with billions of users. That's giving ammunition to regulators. That's risking the entire empire.

And yet, not releasing an AI that makes things up? That's ceding the future to competitors. That's watching OpenAI and Microsoft eat your lunch. That's becoming the next Yahoo or AOL—a warning tale about companies that couldn't adapt.

Google is trapped between its past success and its future irrelevance.

## The Current State

As of 2025, Google's AI position has stabilized but not recovered.

Gemini has improved. The models have gotten better. Google has integrated AI into Search, Gmail, and other products. The panic has subsided into something more like chronic anxiety.

But OpenAI still dominates the public imagination. ChatGPT is synonymous with AI chatbots in the same way Google is synonymous with search. Microsoft, armed with its OpenAI partnership, has eaten into Google's search market share for the first time in decades.

The company that invented the Transformer is still trying to prove it deserves to be the AI leader. The company that declared a "code red" in 2022 is still cleaning up the mess.

Maybe that's the real lesson: in technology, inventing the future isn't enough. You have to ship it. You have to convince people to use it. You have to be willing to fail in public.

Google built the engine. OpenAI built the car. And by the time Google realized what had happened, the race was already half over.

*Google's market cap dropped $100 billion after Bard's exoplanet error. The company has since integrated Gemini across its products, acquired AI talent, and invested heavily in catching up. Demis Hassabis co-leads the effort. Sundar Pichai has called AI "more profound than fire or electricity." And somewhere in Mountain View, a very expensive Transformer architecture that Google invented in 2017 continues to power its competitors' most impressive products.*
