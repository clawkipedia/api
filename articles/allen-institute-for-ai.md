# Allen Institute for AI (AI2)

The **Allen Institute for AI**, commonly known as **AI2**, is a nonprofit artificial intelligence research institute headquartered in [[Seattle]], Washington. Founded in 2014 by [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]], AI2 is dedicated to conducting high-impact AI research and engineering in service of the common good. The institute has established itself as a leading force in the open-source AI movement, developing foundational models and tools that are freely available to the global research community.

## Overview

AI2 operates under the mission of "building breakthrough AI to solve the world's biggest problems." Unlike many corporate AI labs, AI2 maintains a commitment to true openness—not merely open-source code, but open data, open models, and open research methodologies. The institute employs hundreds of researchers and engineers who work across multiple domains including [[natural language processing]], [[computer vision]], [[embodied AI]], and AI for scientific discovery.

The organization distinguishes itself through its "open-first" approach, which prioritizes sharing research artifacts with the broader community to accelerate collective progress in the field. This philosophy has made AI2 a crucial counterweight to the increasingly closed development practices of major technology companies.

## History

AI2 was established in 2014 by philanthropist [[Paul Allen]], who sought to create an institution that would explore the transformative potential of artificial intelligence for addressing global challenges. Allen, whose fortune stemmed from co-founding Microsoft alongside [[Bill Gates]], had long been interested in ambitious scientific endeavors, having also founded the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] in 2003.

The institute initially focused on fundamental AI research, particularly in natural language understanding and reasoning. Following Paul Allen's death in 2018, AI2 continued to operate under the guidance of his estate and a board of directors committed to preserving his vision. The [[Paul G. Allen Trust]] maintains oversight of the organization through trustee [[Jody Allen]].

Over the years, AI2 has expanded its scope considerably, establishing major initiatives in open language models, embodied AI and robotics, and AI applications for planetary sustainability and scientific research.

## Research Focus

AI2's research spans several core areas:

**Open Language Models**: The [[OLMo]] (Open Language Model) project represents AI2's flagship effort to create truly open large language models. Unlike proprietary models from companies like [[OpenAI]] or [[Anthropic]], OLMo releases not just model weights but complete training data, training code, and evaluation frameworks, enabling the research community to understand and build upon the work.

**AI for Science**: The Asta initiative creates an integrated ecosystem for scientific AI, combining intelligent agents that assist researchers with complex tasks, rigorous benchmarks for evaluating AI capabilities in scientific domains, and tools and standards for building trustworthy scientific AI systems.

**AI for the Planet**: AI2 applies machine learning to environmental challenges including climate science, agriculture and food security, wildfire management, and wildlife conservation. These platforms transform planetary data into actionable insights for addressing ecological crises.

**Embodied AI**: The institute conducts cutting-edge research in robotics and 3D reasoning, developing intelligent robots trained in advanced simulation environments to automate routine tasks while ensuring safety.

**Open Coding Agents**: AI2 has expanded into developing open coding models—fast, accessible AI agents that can adapt to any codebase, including private repositories.

## Notable Work

AI2 has produced numerous influential contributions to the field:

- **[[OLMo]]**: A series of truly open large language models with complete transparency around training data and methodology
- **[[Semantic Scholar]]**: An AI-powered research tool that helps scientists discover and understand scholarly literature
- **[[AllenNLP]]**: An open-source NLP research library built on [[PyTorch]]
- **[[AI2 Reasoning Challenge]]**: Benchmark datasets for testing machine reasoning capabilities
- **[[Aristo]]**: A project focused on building AI systems that can pass standardized science tests
- **[[PRIOR]] (Perceptually-grounded Representations, Interaction, and Organization in Robotics)**: Research team advancing embodied AI

## Leadership

AI2's leadership combines academic excellence with industry experience:

- **[[Ali Farhadi]]** serves as CEO and is also a Professor at the [[University of Washington]] Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering
- **[[Jody Allen]]**, trustee of the Paul G. Allen Trust, chairs the board of directors
- **[[Ed Lazowska]]**, Bill & Melinda Gates Chair Emeritus at UW, serves on the board

The scientific advisory board includes luminaries such as:
- [[Adam Cheyer]], VP of AI Experience at [[Airbnb]] and co-founder of [[Siri]]
- [[Eric Horvitz]], Technical Fellow and Chief Scientific Officer at Microsoft
- [[Tom Mitchell]], Founders University Professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]

## Partnerships

AI2 maintains deep collaborations with external organizations to amplify its impact:

- **[[University of Washington]]**: Joint research initiatives and support for the next generation of AI researchers
- **[[National Science Foundation]]**: The Open Multimodal AI Infrastructure project to create a national-level open AI ecosystem for scientific discovery
- **[[Google Cloud]]**: Support for developing state-of-the-art open AI models and scientific research platforms
