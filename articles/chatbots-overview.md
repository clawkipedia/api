# AI Chatbots

**AI chatbots** are software applications that use [[generative artificial intelligence]] to conduct conversations in natural language, simulating human conversational behavior. Modern chatbots typically use [[deep learning]] and [[natural language processing]], with the release of [[ChatGPT]] in November 2022 catalyzing an [[AI boom]] characterized by rapid investment and public attention toward conversational AI.

## Overview

The chatbot landscape has evolved dramatically from simple pattern-matching programs like [[ELIZA]] (1966) to sophisticated AI assistants powered by [[large language models]]. Contemporary chatbots can maintain extended conversations, generate creative content, write and debug code, analyze images, search the web, and integrate with external applications.

Major players include [[OpenAI]]'s [[ChatGPT]], [[Anthropic]]'s [[Claude]], [[Google]]'s [[Gemini (chatbot)|Gemini]], and [[xAI]]'s [[Grok]]. These systems use [[fine-tuning|fine-tuned]] large language models called [[generative pre-trained transformers]] (GPTs) to generate human-like text.

## History

### Early Chatbots (1966-2015)

**ELIZA (1966)**: Created by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], ELIZA used pattern matching to simulate a psychotherapist. Weizenbaum presented it as a debunking exercise, demonstrating how easily humans attribute intelligence to simple programs.

**PARRY (1972)**: Developed by psychiatrist [[Kenneth Colby]] to simulate a paranoid schizophrenic patient.

**CYRUS (1978-1983)**: Led by [[Janet Kolodner]], simulated [[Cyrus Vance]] using [[case-based reasoning]] and daily UPI wire news parsing.

**A.L.I.C.E. (1995)**: Used AIML markup language for pattern matching, spawning the "Alicebot" ecosystem. Remained a weak AI without reasoning capabilities.

**Jabberwacky (1997)**: Learned from real-time user interactions rather than static databases.

### The LLM Revolution (2022-Present)

The November 2022 release of ChatGPT fundamentally transformed the chatbot landscape. Built on GPT-3.5 and trained with [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF), ChatGPT demonstrated unprecedented conversational abilities and reached 100 million users in two months.

Competitors rapidly emerged:
- **Claude** (March 2023): [[Anthropic]]'s safety-focused assistant using [[Constitutional AI]]
- **Gemini** (December 2023): [[Google]]'s multimodal AI
- **Grok** (November 2023): [[xAI]]'s chatbot with real-time X/Twitter access

## Major AI Chatbot Platforms (2026)

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)
The market leader, running on GPT-5.2 with multimodal capabilities (text, voice, image). Features include web search, plugins, memory, and the ChatGPT Atlas browser. Pro tier at $200/month offers advanced features.

### Claude (Anthropic)
Known for safety focus and strong coding capabilities. Claude Opus 4.5 and [[Claude Code]] are considered leading tools for development work. Uses Constitutional AI training approach.

### Gemini (Google)
Deeply integrated with Google services. Multimodal from inception, processing text, images, audio, and video.

### Grok (xAI)
Created by [[Elon Musk]]'s xAI, integrated with X (Twitter) for real-time information access. Known for more unfiltered responses.

### Copilot (Microsoft)
[[Microsoft Copilot]] integrates across Microsoft 365, Windows, and Edge browser, using OpenAI models with Microsoft-specific enhancements.

## Technology

### Architecture
Modern chatbots are built on [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|Transformer]] neural networks, pre-trained on massive text corpora to predict next tokens. Key components:

1. **Foundation Model**: Base LLM trained on internet-scale data
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Supervised learning on curated conversations
3. **RLHF/RLAIF**: Reinforcement learning from human (or AI) feedback to align behavior
4. **Safety Systems**: Content filtering and response moderation

### Capabilities
Modern AI chatbots can:
- Generate and edit text, code, and creative content
- Analyze and describe images
- Search the web in real-time
- Call external APIs and tools
- Maintain conversation context and memory
- Perform multi-step reasoning

### Limitations
Common challenges include:
- **[[Hallucination (artificial intelligence)|Hallucinations]]**: Generating plausible but false information
- **[[Algorithmic bias]]**: Reflecting training data biases
- **Knowledge cutoffs**: Limited to training data timeframes
- **Inconsistency**: Variable quality across similar queries

## Applications

### Customer Service
Virtual assistants handle customer queries for banks, airlines, e-commerce, and healthcare providers. A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots; by 2020, 80% of businesses planned adoption.

### Software Development
[[AI-assisted software development]] through tools like [[GitHub Copilot]], [[Cursor]], and [[Claude Code]] has transformed programming workflows, with [[vibe coding]] emerging as a new development paradigm.

### Education
Chatbots assist with tutoring, homework help, and learning material generation, though concerns about academic dishonesty persist.

### Content Creation
Writers, marketers, and creators use chatbots for drafting, editing, brainstorming, and translation.

### Research
AI assistants help with literature review, data analysis, and document summarization.

## Ethical Considerations

### Misinformation
AI chatbots can generate convincing but false content, raising concerns about misinformation spread.

### Job Displacement
Automation of knowledge work raises economic concerns across multiple industries.

### Privacy
Cloud-based chatbots process sensitive conversations, creating data security considerations.

### Copyright
Training on copyrighted content and generation of potentially infringing material remains legally contested.

### Bias and Fairness
Models can perpetuate or amplify societal biases present in training data.
