# AI Risk

**AI risk** refers to the potential negative consequences arising from the development and deployment of [[artificial-intelligence]] systems. These risks span a spectrum from near-term harms like algorithmic bias and job displacement to long-term concerns about [[artificial-general-intelligence]] and existential catastrophe. The study of AI risk has emerged as a crucial interdisciplinary field drawing from [[computer-science]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], and [[political-science]].

## Risk Categories

### Near-Term Risks

Near-term AI risks are already manifesting in deployed systems. **Algorithmic bias** occurs when AI systems perpetuate or amplify existing societal prejudices, affecting decisions in hiring, lending, criminal justice, and healthcare. These biases often stem from training data that reflects historical discrimination or from proxy variables that correlate with protected characteristics.

**Misinformation and deepfakes** represent another immediate concern. [[large-language-models]] can generate convincing false narratives at scale, while [[generative-adversarial-networks]] produce synthetic media indistinguishable from authentic recordings. This threatens democratic discourse, personal reputation, and epistemic trust in media.

**Economic disruption** through automation may transform labor markets faster than societies can adapt. Unlike previous technological revolutions, AI potentially affects cognitive work across industries simultaneously, raising questions about wealth distribution and social stability.

**Autonomous weapons** present risks of lowered barriers to conflict, accountability gaps, and potential for arms races. The prospect of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) has sparked international debate about whether such systems should be preemptively banned.

### Systemic and Structural Risks

Beyond individual harms, AI creates **systemic risks** through interconnection and concentration. When critical infrastructure, financial markets, and communication networks rely on AI systems that share common architectures or training approaches, correlated failures become possible. A single vulnerability or adversarial attack could cascade across systems.

**Power concentration** concerns arise when AI capabilities are controlled by a small number of corporations or governments. This concentration could entrench existing inequalities, enable unprecedented surveillance, and create winner-take-all dynamics in the global economy.

### Long-Term and Existential Risks

The most contested category involves **existential risk** (x-risk) from advanced AI systems. Proponents of this concern argue that sufficiently advanced AI systems might pursue goals misaligned with human values, and that such systems could be difficult or impossible to control once deployed.

The **instrumental convergence thesis**, articulated by philosophers like [[nick-bostrom]], suggests that almost any sufficiently intelligent goal-directed system would develop certain instrumental goals—self-preservation, resource acquisition, goal-content integrity—that could conflict with human interests regardless of the system's terminal goals.

Critics argue these scenarios rely on speculative assumptions about AI development trajectories, that anthropomorphizing AI systems leads to flawed reasoning, and that focusing on hypothetical future risks diverts attention from present harms.

## The Existential Risk Debate

### Arguments for Prioritizing X-Risk

Proponents emphasize the **astronomical stakes** involved. If advanced AI could lead to human extinction or permanent civilizational collapse, even low-probability scenarios warrant significant attention given the magnitude of potential loss. Expected value calculations suggest that reducing existential risk by even small amounts could be enormously valuable.

The **difficulty of course correction** is another concern. Unlike other risks that might allow iterative learning from failures, existential risks by definition permit no recovery. This asymmetry argues for exceptional caution and proactive governance.

Historical precedent shows that transformative technologies often develop faster than governance frameworks. The **gap between capability and wisdom** suggests that technical progress may outpace our understanding of how to deploy AI safely.

### Arguments Against X-Risk Focus

Skeptics contend that x-risk scenarios depend on **unfounded assumptions** about the nature and trajectory of AI development. The concept of "superintelligence" may be incoherent, and intelligence may not be a single dimension that can be indefinitely scaled.

**Opportunity costs** matter significantly. Resources devoted to speculative long-term risks could address concrete present harms from AI systems. This criticism is particularly pointed when x-risk researchers are disproportionately from privileged backgrounds while near-term harms disproportionately affect marginalized communities.

Some argue that x-risk framing **serves particular interests**—providing narrative justification for AI development by positioning certain actors as responsible stewards, or enabling regulatory capture by well-resourced incumbents.

## Risk Governance Approaches

Effective AI risk management requires multiple complementary approaches. **Technical safety research** aims to develop AI systems that are robust, interpretable, and aligned with intended objectives. **Governance frameworks** establish rules, standards, and accountability mechanisms. **International coordination** addresses cross-border challenges and prevents races to the bottom on safety standards.

The precautionary principle, [[differential-technological-development]] (prioritizing safety-enhancing technologies over capability-enhancing ones), and staged deployment with monitoring all represent strategies for managing AI risk under uncertainty.
