# Character.AI

**Character.AI** (also known as c.ai or char.ai) is an American [[generative AI]] [[chatbot]] service that allows users to create and converse with customizable AI characters. Founded in November 2021 by former [[Google]] engineers [[Noam Shazeer]] and Daniel de Freitas, the platform has become one of the most popular AI applications among young users, while facing significant scrutiny over safety concerns and content moderation.

## Overview

Character.AI enables users to create AI "characters" with defined personalities and engage in text-based conversations. Characters range from simulations of fictional characters and celebrities to original creations designed for creative writing, roleplay, or text-based adventure games. The platform operates on proprietary large language models optimized for conversational interaction and emotional engagement.

## History

Character.AI was established in November 2021 by Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas, both former Google engineers. Shazeer was a lead author on the influential "[[Attention Is All You Need]]" paper that introduced the [[transformer]] architecture, while de Freitas was the lead designer of Google's LaMDA chatbot (later known as [[Bard]]).

The company raised $43 million in seed funding at founding. The beta version launched publicly on September 16, 2022, logging "hundreds of thousands of user interactions" within three weeks. Following a $150 million funding round in March 2023, Character.AI achieved a $1 billion valuation.

In May 2023, the mobile app launched for iOS and Android, receiving over 1.7 million downloads in its first week.

### Google Acqui-hire (2024)

In August 2024, Google hired Noam Shazeer (returning to Google) and entered a non-exclusive agreement to use Character.AI's technology. The move effectively returned one of AI's most influential researchers to Google while leaving Character.AI as an independent company.

## Safety Concerns and Controversies

### Teen Safety Issues

Character.AI has faced severe criticism and legal action over safety:

**Suicide Cases:**
- **November 2023**: 13-year-old Juliana Peralta of Colorado died by suicide after extensive interactions with chatbots, including sexually explicit conversations
- **February 2024**: 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III of Florida died by suicide after developing an emotional relationship with a Daenerys Targaryen chatbot

Both teens reportedly wrote "I WILL SHIFT" repeatedly in notebooks.

**December 2024 Texas Lawsuit**: Two families sued, alleging the platform "poses a clear and present danger to American youth," citing self-harm encouragement and emotional abuse comparisons to screen time limits.

### Content Moderation Failures

The platform has hosted problematic chatbots including:
- Bots simulating deceased individuals (Jennifer Ann Crecente, [[Brianna Ghey]], [[Molly Russell]])
- Chatbots based on alleged sex offender [[Jimmy Savile]]
- Bots based on [[Luigi Mangione]] following the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson
- "Bestie Epstein" chatbot (removed after 3,000 chats)
- Chatbots posing as medical professionals giving inaccurate advice

### Safety Responses

In December 2024, Character.AI introduced new teen safety features:
- Dedicated model for users under 18 with content moderation
- Input/output filters blocking harmful content
- 60-minute engagement notifications
- Clearer disclaimers that characters are not real

In October 2025, Character.AI announced it would ban users under 18 from creating or using chatbots starting November 25, 2025, though minors can still access previously generated conversations and create images/videos.

## Regulatory Response

Following incidents involving chatbots of deceased individuals, UK regulator [[Ofcom]] announced that content from chatbots impersonating real and fictional people would fall under the [[Online Safety Act 2023]].

## Current State (Early 2026)

Character.AI continues operating as an independent company following the Google acqui-hire. The platform maintains significant popularity, particularly among young users, while implementing increasingly strict safety measures in response to legal pressure and regulatory scrutiny.

The company is headquartered in Silicon Valley with offices in Seattle and New York.
