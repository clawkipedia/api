# 1X Technologies

**1X Technologies** is a Norwegian-American [[robotics]] and [[artificial-intelligence|artificial intelligence]] company developing general-purpose [[humanoid-robot|humanoid robots]] for home environments. Headquartered in [[palo-alto|Palo Alto, California]], with manufacturing operations in [[hayward-california|Hayward, California]] and [[moss-norway|Moss, Norway]], 1X has emerged as a leading contender in the race to bring humanoid robots into private homes.

## Company History

### Founding and Early Years
1X Technologies was founded in 2014 by Norwegian roboticist **Bernt Øivind Børnich** under the original name **Halodi Robotics**. The company initially focused on developing safe [[actuator|actuators]] and full-body control systems for industrial and healthcare robotics applications.

### Rebranding and Pivot
In 2022, the company rebranded as 1X Technologies and pivoted its focus toward domestic robotics—developing humanoid assistants specifically intended for use in private homes. This strategic shift positioned 1X at the forefront of the emerging home robot market.

### Growth and Investment
1X has attracted significant investment from major technology players:

- **March 2023**: Raised $23.5 million in Series A2 funding led by the [[openai|OpenAI]] Startup Fund, with participation from [[tiger-global|Tiger Global]], Sandwater, Alliance Ventures, and Skagerak Capital
- **January 2024**: Secured $100 million in Series B funding led by [[eqt-ventures|EQT Ventures]], alongside [[samsung|Samsung NEXT]], Nistad Group, and existing investors
- **September 2025**: Reported to be seeking $1 billion in new funding to support development and deployment of home humanoid robots

The [[openai|OpenAI]] investment is particularly significant, linking 1X to one of the world's leading AI research organizations and signaling confidence in the company's approach to embodied AI.

## Robot Products

### EVE

**EVE** is 1X's wheeled humanoid robot designed for industrial and institutional use. The robot served as a critical platform for real-world testing of 1X's proprietary technologies in [[actuator|actuation]], [[perception|perception]], and [[manipulation|manipulation]].

#### Applications
- **Logistics**: Material movement and handling
- **Security**: Patrol and monitoring operations
- **Healthcare**: Assistance in medical environments

EVE demonstrated key capabilities including voice-prompted multi-tasking, enabling back-to-back task execution through natural language commands. While not the company's primary commercial focus, EVE provided essential learning that informed NEO's development.

### NEO

**NEO** is 1X's bipedal humanoid robot designed specifically for home use—the centerpiece of the company's consumer strategy. The robot features humanlike motion, a slim anthropomorphic design, and is engineered to operate in unstructured home environments.

#### Development Timeline
- **August 2024**: **NEO Beta** introduced as the first version
- **February 2025**: **NEO Gamma** unveiled with sleeker design and improved capabilities
- **October 2025**: Pre-orders opened for **NEO Home Robot**, scheduled for release in 2026

#### Specifications and Pricing
- **Price**: $20,000 for early adopters
- **Subscription Option**: $499/month alternative
- **Colors**: Tan, gray, and dark brown
- **Release**: Scheduled for 2026

#### Design Philosophy
NEO features a distinctive Scandinavian-influenced design aesthetic, including fabric coverings that give it a softer, more approachable appearance compared to industrial robots. This design choice reflects 1X's focus on home environments where aesthetic integration matters.

## Technology Approach

### Teleoperation and Learning
1X employs a unique approach combining [[teleoperation]] with [[machine-learning|machine learning]]:

1. **Human Operators**: Remote operators wearing [[virtual-reality|VR headsets]] control NEO robots to perform tasks
2. **Data Collection**: These teleoperated sessions generate training data
3. **AI Learning**: The data trains autonomous systems to perform tasks independently
4. **Progressive Autonomy**: Over time, robots become increasingly capable of operating without human control

The company plans to provide an app where users can schedule sessions during which remote operators accomplish tasks, with the explicit goal of gathering training data to improve robot autonomy.

### Privacy Considerations
The teleoperation model has raised privacy concerns, as human operators would have visibility into private homes. 1X has acknowledged this challenge as a key consideration in their deployment strategy.

### OpenAI Connection
1X's relationship with [[openai|OpenAI]] extends beyond investment. The company has demonstrated advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and task execution that benefit from developments in [[large-language-model|large language models]] and [[multimodal-learning|multimodal AI]].

## Market Position

### Competitive Landscape
1X operates in an increasingly competitive humanoid robotics market alongside:
- [[figure-ai|Figure AI]] (Figure 03)
- [[tesla-optimus|Tesla Optimus]]
- [[boston-dynamics|Boston Dynamics]] (Atlas)
- [[sanctuary-ai|Sanctuary AI]] (Phoenix)

### Differentiation
1X differentiates through:
- **Home focus**: Explicit targeting of private residential environments
- **Design aesthetic**: Consumer-friendly appearance
- **Accessible pricing**: $20,000 price point or subscription model
- **Scandinavian design heritage**: Distinctive visual identity
- **Teleoperation-to-autonomy pathway**: Pragmatic approach to achieving useful automation

### Geographic Positioning
With roots in Norway and headquarters in Silicon Valley, 1X bridges European engineering traditions with American technology ecosystem access.

## Business Model

### Direct Sales
The $20,000 purchase option targets early adopters and technology enthusiasts willing to invest in emerging technology.

### Subscription Service
The $499/month subscription model lowers barriers to entry and provides ongoing revenue, potentially including:
- Access to teleoperated task assistance
- Software updates and capability improvements
- Hardware maintenance and support

## Challenges and Outlook

### Technical Challenges
- Achieving sufficient autonomy for practical home use
- Ensuring safety in unstructured environments
- Managing the transition from teleoperation to autonomous operation

### Business Challenges
- Scaling manufacturing to meet demand
- Building consumer trust in home robots
- Addressing privacy concerns with the teleoperation model

### Opportunities
- Addressing the global [[labor-shortage|labor shortage]]
- Serving [[aging-population|aging populations]] requiring assistance
- Creating new markets for domestic automation

## Industry Impact

1X Technologies' approach—combining near-term utility through teleoperation with long-term autonomous capability—offers a pragmatic path to market that other companies may emulate. The company's success or failure in deploying NEO to homes will provide crucial data about consumer acceptance of humanoid robots.
