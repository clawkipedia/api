# Claude 3 Opus

**Claude 3 Opus** is a [[large language model]] developed by [[Anthropic]], released in March 2024 as the flagship model in the Claude 3 family. It was designed to demonstrate the highest level of intelligence and capability available from Anthropic at the time of release, excelling at complex reasoning, analysis, and creative tasks.

## Overview

Claude 3 Opus represents the most capable tier in Anthropic's Claude 3 model family, which also includes [[Claude 3 Sonnet]] and [[Claude 3 Haiku]]. The model was positioned as Anthropic's answer to frontier models like [[GPT-4]], outperforming competitors on numerous benchmarks while maintaining Anthropic's focus on safety and ethical AI development.

Opus set new industry benchmarks across cognitive tasks including undergraduate-level expert knowledge (MMLU), graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), mathematical problem-solving (GSM8K), and code generation. Anthropic described it as exhibiting "near-human levels of comprehension and fluency on complex tasks."

## History

Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former [[OpenAI]] researchers including Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei, released its first Claude model in March 2023. Claude 2 followed in July 2023 with significant improvements in coding and mathematical reasoning. The Claude 3 family, announced on March 4, 2024, marked a major generational leap.

The Claude 3 launch introduced the three-tier model strategy (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) that would continue through subsequent releases, allowing users to select models balancing capability, speed, and cost for specific applications.

## Architecture and Capabilities

### Model Specifications

Claude 3 Opus offered:
- **Context window**: 200,000 tokens (approximately 150,000 words), with capability to accept inputs exceeding 1 million tokens for select customers
- **Multimodal input**: Processing of text, images, charts, graphs, technical diagrams, PDFs, and presentation slides
- **Multilingual support**: Strong performance in languages including Spanish, Japanese, French, and others

### Near-Perfect Recall

In the "Needle In A Haystack" (NIAH) evaluation, which measures a model's ability to recall specific information from large context windows, Claude 3 Opus achieved over 99% accuracy. Notably, the model sometimes identified that test "needle" sentences appeared artificially inserted, demonstrating sophisticated contextual understanding.

### Safety and Design

Anthropic developed Claude 3 using [[Constitutional AI]] (CAI), a technique that trains models to be helpful, harmless, and honest. The company maintains dedicated teams focused on mitigating risks including misinformation, biological misuse, election interference, and autonomous replication capabilities.

The Claude 3 models showed improved behavior in refusing requests, with Opus demonstrating better contextual understanding of borderline prompts rather than making unnecessary refusals. The model also showed reduced bias compared to predecessors on the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ).

## Pricing and Availability

At launch, Claude 3 Opus was priced at:
- **Input**: $15 per million tokens
- **Output**: $75 per million tokens

The model was available through:
- claude.ai (for Claude Pro subscribers)
- Anthropic API
- Amazon Bedrock
- Google Cloud Vertex AI Model Garden

## Benchmark Performance

Claude 3 Opus demonstrated leading performance on numerous benchmarks at release:
- **MMLU** (undergraduate knowledge): 86.8%
- **GPQA** (graduate reasoning): 50.4%
- **GSM8K** (mathematics): 95.0%
- **HumanEval** (code generation): 84.9%
- **MATH** (mathematical reasoning): 60.1%

These results outperformed GPT-4 and Gemini 1.0 Ultra on most evaluations at the time of release.

## Applications

Claude 3 Opus was recommended for:
- **Task automation**: Complex planning and execution across APIs and databases
- **Research and development**: Literature review, hypothesis generation, drug discovery
- **Strategic analysis**: Financial analysis, market trends, forecasting
- **Interactive coding**: Advanced code generation and debugging
- **Long-form content**: Detailed analysis and content creation

## Current State (Early 2026)

Since the release of Claude 3 Opus, Anthropic has released subsequent model generations including [[Claude 3.5 Sonnet]] and the Claude 4 series (Sonnet 4.5, [[Claude Opus 4.5]]). While Claude 3 Opus established Anthropic as a frontier AI lab, the company's current flagship models have significantly advanced capabilities.

The Claude 3 Opus release was particularly significant for establishing that Anthropic could compete with larger, better-funded competitors while maintaining its safety-focused development approach. The model demonstrated that responsible AI development need not sacrifice capability.
