# xAI

**xAI** (legally X.AI Corp.) is an American [[artificial intelligence]] company founded by [[Elon Musk]] in March 2023. The company develops the [[Grok]] family of AI chatbots and, following its March 2025 acquisition of [[X Corp.]], operates the social media platform [[X (formerly Twitter)]]. In February 2026, xAI was acquired by [[SpaceX]], creating a combined entity valued at $1.25 trillion.

## Overview

xAI is headquartered at [[Stanford Research Park]] in Palo Alto, California. The company was initially incorporated in Nevada as a [[public benefit corporation]] with the stated purpose of "creating a material positive impact on society and the environment," though it dropped this status by May 2024. Its original mission statement was "to understand the true nature of the universe."

Musk founded xAI partly in response to what he characterized as "politically correct" AI systems, stating that such approaches would be "incredibly dangerous" and misleading. He positioned xAI as creating "maximally truth-seeking" AI with better mathematical reasoning capabilities.

## History

### Founding and Early Growth (2023-2024)

xAI was founded on March 9, 2023, with Musk recruiting Igor Babuschkin, formerly of [[Google DeepMind]], as Chief Engineer. The company was officially announced on July 12, 2023.

Initial funding came through multiple rounds:
- December 2023: $134.7 million raised out of planned $1 billion
- May 2024: $6 billion raised with support from [[Andreessen Horowitz]], [[Lightspeed Venture Partners]], [[Sequoia Capital]], and [[Tribe Capital]]
- December 2024: Additional $6 billion from [[Fidelity]], [[BlackRock]], and Sequoia Capital

In November 2023, Musk announced that X Corp investors would own 25% of xAI, establishing the connection between his AI venture and social media platform.

### Acquisitions and Expansion (2025-2026)

In March 2025, xAI acquired Hotshot, a startup focused on AI-powered video generation. Later that month, xAI acquired X Corp. in an all-stock transaction valuing X at $33 billion ($45 billion including debt) and xAI at $80 billion. The combined entity became X.AI Holdings Corp.

In July 2025, Morgan Stanley raised $5 billion in debt and xAI separately raised $5 billion in equity, with [[SpaceX]] investing $2 billion.

On February 2, 2026, SpaceX acquired xAI in a deal that valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, creating a combined $1.25 trillion entity under Musk's control.

### Colossus Supercomputer

In June 2024, xAI announced plans to build [[Colossus]], described as the world's largest supercomputer, in Memphis, Tennessee. After 122 days of construction, Colossus became fully operational in December 2024.

The project has faced environmental concerns regarding:
- Power consumption: 150 megawatts at peak, requiring deployment of 14 VoltaGrid methane-gas powered generators
- Air pollution: Environmental advocates reported the gas-burning turbines emit large quantities of polluting gases and operated without proper permits
- In July 2025, Shelby County Health Department granted xAI an air permit

In November 2025, Musk announced plans for a 30-megawatt solar farm near Colossus, though this represents only 10% of the data center's estimated power use.

By December 2025, xAI purchased a third building to expand training capacity to nearly 2 gigawatts, with plans to house at least 1 million GPUs.

### Gaming

In October 2025, Musk announced xAI had established a dedicated game studio to develop AI-driven video games, with plans to release a major AI-generated game before the end of 2026.

## Controversies

In August 2024, reports emerged that Musk was diverting Nvidia chips ordered by [[Tesla, Inc.]] to X and xAI.

In September 2025, xAI laid off 500 data annotation workers from what had been the company's largest division, marking a significant operational shift.

Environmental groups have criticized Colossus's energy consumption and emissions, with the [[Southern Environmental Law Center]] stating the gas turbines produce about 2,000 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions annually.
