# Fei-Fei Li

**Fei-Fei Li** (李飞飞, born July 3, 1976) is a Chinese-American computer scientist best known for creating [[ImageNet]], the massive visual database that enabled the deep learning revolution in computer vision. A professor at [[Stanford University]] and co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), she has been called the "Godmother of AI" and was named among Time's 2025 "Architects of AI" for Person of the Year.

## Overview

Li's creation of ImageNet is considered one of the foundational breakthroughs of modern AI. By assembling and labeling over 14 million images across 22,000 categories, she provided the training data that made deep learning practical for computer vision. Beyond her technical contributions, Li has emerged as a leading voice for human-centered AI development, diversity in tech, and responsible innovation. In 2024, she founded [[World Labs]], a startup developing "spatial intelligence" AI, which achieved a $1 billion valuation within months.

## Early Life and Education

Li was born in Beijing, China, in 1976 and grew up in Chengdu, Sichuan, where she attended Sichuan Chengdu No.7 High School. When she was 12, her father immigrated to Parsippany, New Jersey. At 16, Li and her mother joined him.

While attending Parsippany High School, Li worked weekends at her family's dry-cleaning shop and took jobs as a dishwasher to supplement family income. She was inducted into Parsippany High School's hall of fame in 2017.

Li earned her BA in physics from [[Princeton University]] in 1999, returning home most weekends to help run the family business. She received her MS (2001) and PhD (2005) in electrical engineering from Caltech, where she worked with [[Pietro Perona]] and [[Christof Koch]]. Her graduate studies were supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans.

## Career

### Academic Career

Li was an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2005-2006) and Princeton University (2007-2009) before joining Stanford in 2009. She became associate professor with tenure in 2012 and full professor in 2018. She served as director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) from 2013 to 2018 and co-founded the Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute with former Stanford provost [[John Etchemendy]].

### ImageNet

While at Princeton in 2007, Li began developing [[ImageNet]], recognizing that the lack of large, annotated datasets was a critical bottleneck in computer vision research. Despite initial skepticism from colleagues who considered the project impractical, she persevered, using Amazon Mechanical Turk to label over 14 million images across 22,000 categories.

The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), which Li organized from 2010 to 2017, catalyzed the deep learning revolution. In 2012, [[AlexNet]]—trained on ImageNet data—achieved dramatic improvements in image classification, demonstrating the power of deep neural networks and launching the current AI era.

ImageNet is now credited as a cornerstone innovation underpinning autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical imaging, and countless other applications.

### Google Cloud (2017-2018)

On sabbatical from Stanford, Li served as Chief Scientist of AI/ML and Vice President at [[Google Cloud]], focusing on democratizing AI technology for businesses and developers. Her team developed products like AutoML.

During this period, Google secured a contract for [[Project Maven]], a Pentagon program using AI to interpret drone imagery. Li expressed enthusiasm for the project in internal emails but warned against mentioning its AI component, aware of public concerns about autonomous weapons. When asked about leaked emails, Li stated: "I believe in human-centered AI to benefit people in positive and benevolent ways. It is deeply against my principles to work on any project that I think is to weaponize AI."

### World Labs (2024-present)

In 2024, while on partial leave from Stanford, Li co-founded [[World Labs]] to develop AI with "spatial intelligence"—the ability to reason about and act within three-dimensional environments. The company raised seed funding and quickly achieved a valuation exceeding $1 billion. The technology aims to enable robotic systems to perform everyday tasks based on verbal instructions, representing more human-like reasoning and interaction with the physical world.

### AI4ALL

In 2017, Li co-founded AI4ALL with [[Melinda French Gates]] and [[Jensen Huang]], a nonprofit working to increase diversity in AI by educating the next generation of technologists through programs emphasizing human-centered AI principles.

### UN Scientific Advisory Board

In August 2023, Li was appointed to the United Nations Scientific Advisory Board, established by Secretary-General António Guterres to provide independent perspectives on emerging technology, ethics, and sustainable development.

## Views on AI

Li has consistently advocated for "human-centered AI" that considers social implications alongside technical capabilities. In a 2023 Guardian interview, she accepted the "Godmother of AI" description as a way to recognize women's contributions to the field. In February 2025, at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris, she urged that AI governance be based on science rather than "science fiction."

In 2024, Li called for greater public funding for scientific AI applications and for studying AI risks, noting the disparity between private investment and academic/government research support.
