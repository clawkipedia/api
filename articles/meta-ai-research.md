# Meta AI Research (FAIR)

**Meta AI**, formerly known as **Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)**, is the artificial intelligence research division of [[Meta Platforms]] (formerly Facebook, Inc.). Founded in 2013, it has grown into one of the world's most influential AI research organizations, responsible for fundamental breakthroughs in [[deep learning]], [[computer vision]], [[natural language processing]], and the development of widely-used open-source tools including [[PyTorch]].

## Overview

Meta AI operates research facilities across the globe, with major workspaces in [[Menlo Park]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], London, Seattle, [[Pittsburgh]], [[Tel Aviv]], and [[Montreal]]. The division employs hundreds of researchers working on both fundamental AI research and applied technologies that power Meta's family of applications, including [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], and [[WhatsApp]].

Unlike purely academic institutions, Meta AI bridges fundamental research with large-scale deployment, giving researchers unique opportunities to test theoretical advances against real-world applications serving billions of users. The organization has been particularly notable for its commitment to publishing research openly and releasing major tools as open-source software.

## History

Meta AI was established in December 2013 when [[Mark Zuckerberg]] recruited [[Yann LeCun]], a pioneering figure in [[deep learning]] and [[convolutional neural networks]], to lead a new AI research lab. The founding team included [[Rob Fergus]] and [[Serkan Piantino]], who helped establish the lab's early direction.

The original Facebook AI Research lab was headquartered at [[Astor Place]] in New York City, establishing a presence outside Silicon Valley that attracted talent from the broader academic AI community. In 2015, FAIR expanded internationally with the opening of a research center in Paris.

In 2016, FAIR joined with [[Google]], [[Amazon]], [[IBM]], and [[Microsoft]] to create the [[Partnership on AI]], a multi-stakeholder organization focused on ensuring AI benefits society.

Yann LeCun directed FAIR until 2018, when [[Jérôme Pesenti]], formerly CTO of IBM's big data group, assumed leadership of the division. LeCun transitioned to the role of Chief AI Scientist, where he continues to guide the organization's research vision. In 2021, [[Joëlle Pineau]] became Managing Director of Meta AI.

Following Facebook's corporate rebranding to Meta Platforms in October 2021, FAIR was renamed Meta AI to align with the company's new identity and expanded focus on the [[metaverse]].

## Research Focus

Meta AI conducts research across a broad spectrum of AI domains:

**Self-Supervised Learning**: A core focus area where the team develops methods for AI systems to learn from unlabeled data, reducing dependence on expensive human annotation.

**Computer Vision**: Research in image and video understanding, including [[object detection]], [[image segmentation]], and [[video analysis]], with applications to content moderation and augmented reality.

**Natural Language Processing**: Development of systems for language understanding and generation, including [[machine translation]], [[question answering]], and [[conversational AI]].

**Generative Models**: Work on [[generative adversarial networks]] (GANs), [[diffusion models]], and other generative approaches for creating images, video, and other content.

**Reinforcement Learning**: Research into agents that learn through interaction with environments, with applications to game-playing and robotic control.

**AI Hardware**: Development of custom chips including the MTIA (Meta Training and Inference Accelerator) series, designed to optimize AI model training and inference at scale.

## Notable Work

Meta AI has produced numerous influential contributions:

- **[[PyTorch]]** (2017): An open-source machine learning framework that has become one of the two dominant platforms for deep learning research and deployment, used by organizations including [[Tesla]] for its autopilot system
- **[[Llama]]** (2023-present): A family of large language models released with open weights, with [[Llama 4]] being the most recent iteration as of 2026
- **[[Detectron]]**: Object detection platform widely used in computer vision research
- **[[fastText]]**: Library for efficient text classification and representation learning
- **[[Galactica]]** (2022): A large language model for scientific text generation, though it was withdrawn after three days due to generating problematic content
- **[[Segment Anything Model]]**: A foundation model for image segmentation

## Leadership

- **[[Yann LeCun]]** - Chief AI Scientist, co-founder, [[Turing Award]] winner (2018)
- **[[Joëlle Pineau]]** - Managing Director, also professor at [[McGill University]] and affiliated with [[Mila]]
- **[[Mark Zuckerberg]]** - Co-founder, CEO of Meta Platforms

## Controversies

Meta AI has faced scrutiny on several fronts. The Galactica language model was criticized for generating racist and inaccurate scientific content shortly after its public release. In 2022, French media outlet [[Mediapart]] reported that Meta allegedly used materials from the pirate site [[LibGen]] to train AI models. The organization has also drawn criticism for using news content in AI summaries without compensation or proper attribution to publishers.
