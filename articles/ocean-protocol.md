# Ocean Protocol

**Ocean Protocol** is a decentralized data exchange protocol that enables the sharing and monetization of data while preserving privacy. Founded in 2017 by Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol addresses one of the fundamental challenges in [[artificial intelligence]] development: access to high-quality data. The project creates infrastructure for a "data economy" where data assets can be traded, shared, and utilized for AI training while maintaining owner control and privacy.

## Overview

Ocean Protocol operates on the premise that data is the new oil—a valuable resource that fuels the AI revolution. However, unlike oil, data can be copied infinitely, making traditional ownership and commerce models inadequate. Ocean solves this by treating data access rights as tokenized assets on the [[blockchain]], enabling new models for data commerce.

The project's tagline, "Tokenized AI & Data," reflects its approach: using blockchain tokens to represent ownership, access rights, and compute permissions for data assets. This creates what Ocean calls "data legos"—composable building blocks that can be combined with [[DeFi]] protocols and other blockchain infrastructure.

## Technology

### Data NFTs

**Data NFTs** are [[ERC-721]] tokens that represent ownership of unique data assets. Key features include:

- **Self-Custody**: Data owners maintain control of their assets
- **Storage Encryption**: Underlying data remains encrypted and secure
- **Access Controls**: Granular permissions for who can access data
- **ERC725y Features**: Enhanced on-chain metadata and identity capabilities

Data NFTs don't require the data itself to be stored on-chain—only the access control and ownership records. The actual data can reside anywhere: cloud storage, private servers, or decentralized storage networks.

### Datatokens

**Datatokens** are [[ERC-20]] tokens that represent access permissions to Data NFTs. They transform:

- **Crypto wallets** into data wallets
- **Crypto exchanges** into data marketplaces  
- **DAOs** into data cooperatives
- **DeFi protocols** into data finance infrastructure

Each Data NFT can generate one or multiple datatokens with different access levels, pricing, and conditions:

- **Whitelisting**: Restricting access to approved parties
- **Pricing & Promotions**: Flexible pricing models
- **Expiration**: Time-limited access tokens

### Compute-to-Data

**Compute-to-Data** is Ocean's breakthrough privacy-preserving technology that enables AI training on private data without exposing the underlying information. Instead of moving data to computation, computation moves to the data:

1. Data remains in the owner's secure environment
2. Approved algorithms are sent to execute against the data
3. Only results (model outputs, insights) are returned
4. Raw data never leaves the owner's control

This enables:
- **Private data monetization** without privacy compromise
- **Collaborative AI training** across organizations
- **Regulatory compliance** for sensitive data (healthcare, finance)
- **New revenue streams** for data-rich organizations

### Ocean Nodes

**Ocean Nodes** provide the infrastructure layer:

- Decentralized AI capabilities
- Computational resource utilization
- Model development, training, and monetization
- GPU and CPU compatibility
- Secure, developer-friendly environment

## Tokenomics

### OCEAN Token and ASI Alliance

Ocean Protocol's original native token was **OCEAN**, which facilitated transactions in the data marketplace. In 2024, Ocean joined the **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance** alongside [[Fetch.ai]] and [[SingularityNET]], merging their tokens into a unified **ASI token**.

Token utility includes:

- **Data Purchases**: Buyers pay in ASI tokens for data access
- **Staking**: Data curators stake tokens to signal data quality
- **Governance**: Token holders vote on protocol parameters
- **Liquidity Provision**: AMM pools for datatoken trading

### Data as DeFi Collateral

Ocean's architecture enables data assets to participate in DeFi:

- **Data-backed loans**: Using datatokens as collateral
- **Data DEXes**: Automated market makers for data trading
- **Yield optimization**: AI-powered strategies using private data
- **Data stablecoins**: Theoretical tokens backed by data asset baskets

### Predictoor

**Predictoor** is Ocean's application layer for AI-powered prediction markets:

- Run AI prediction bots on crypto price feeds
- Operate trading bots based on predictions
- Earn rewards for accurate predictions
- Combines Ocean's data infrastructure with AI capabilities

## ASI Alliance

In 2024, Ocean Protocol became a founding member of the **Artificial Superintelligence Alliance**, joining [[Fetch.ai]] and [[SingularityNET]] to create unified decentralized AI infrastructure:

- **Ocean Protocol** contributes: Data marketplace, privacy-preserving data sharing, Compute-to-Data
- **[[Fetch.ai]]** contributes: Autonomous agent infrastructure, consumer AI
- **[[SingularityNET]]** contributes: AI marketplace, AGI research

The alliance recognizes that AI development requires three key components: algorithms (SingularityNET), data (Ocean), and autonomous execution (Fetch.ai). By combining these, the ASI Alliance aims to provide complete infrastructure for decentralized AI.

## Use Cases
