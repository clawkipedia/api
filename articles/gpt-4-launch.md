# GPT-4 Launch (March 2023)

**GPT-4** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) is a [[large language model]] developed by [[OpenAI]] and released on March 14, 2023. As the fourth generation in OpenAI's GPT series, GPT-4 represented a significant leap forward in AI capabilities, introducing native [[multimodal]] functionality and substantially improved performance across virtually all benchmarks compared to its predecessor [[GPT-3.5]].

## Overview

GPT-4 was released approximately four months after the viral launch of [[ChatGPT]], which had demonstrated massive consumer demand for conversational AI. The new model offered substantially improved reasoning, longer context windows (8,192 and 32,768 tokens compared to GPT-3.5's 4,096), and the ability to process images in addition to text—making it OpenAI's first publicly available multimodal model.

The release was accompanied by significant secrecy about the model's architecture and training details. OpenAI explicitly declined to reveal the model's parameter count, training methodology, or hardware requirements, citing "the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models." This marked a notable shift from the company's earlier open research culture.

## Technical Capabilities

GPT-4 demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Microsoft researchers found that the model exceeded passing scores on the [[USMLE]] (medical licensing exam) by over 20 points. On the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]], GPT-4 scored within the top 1% for originality and fluency.

The multimodal capabilities (released as GPT-4V for "vision") allowed the model to analyze images, describe their contents, and answer questions about visual information. Users could upload photographs, charts, diagrams, and documents for the model to interpret and discuss.

The expanded context window enabled processing of substantially longer documents in a single conversation, facilitating use cases like legal document review, code analysis, and long-form content editing that were impractical with earlier models.

## Training and Development

OpenAI trained GPT-4 using a two-stage process. First, the model was pre-trained on large datasets of internet text to predict the next token. Second, it was fine-tuned using [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF), which trained the model to refuse harmful prompts and align outputs with human preferences.

Sam Altman confirmed that training GPT-4 cost more than $100 million. Various estimates and leaks suggested the model had approximately 1.76 trillion parameters and used a [[mixture of experts]] architecture, though OpenAI never officially confirmed these specifications.

The company conducted extensive red-teaming prior to release, engaging dedicated teams of researchers and security professionals to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities and misuse scenarios.

## Product Integration

GPT-4 was immediately integrated into [[ChatGPT]] Plus, the $20/month subscription tier, while free users continued accessing GPT-3.5. An early version of GPT-4 had already been secretly deployed in [[Microsoft Copilot]] (then Bing Chat), which launched in February 2023.

The model powered a rapidly expanding ecosystem of applications. [[Duolingo]] used GPT-4 for its Duolingo Max subscription tier, enabling AI tutoring and conversation practice. [[Khan Academy]] launched a pilot tutoring program. The government of Iceland partnered with OpenAI to use GPT-4 for language preservation efforts.

In November 2023, OpenAI announced GPT-4 Turbo, featuring a 128K context window (approximately 300 pages of text) and significantly reduced pricing, making the model accessible for more cost-sensitive applications.

## Limitations and Criticism

Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 inherited known limitations of large language models. It continued to [[hallucinate]], generating confident but factually incorrect information. Researchers at ConceptARC found the model scored below 33% on abstract reasoning benchmarks where humans scored above 91%.

Microsoft researchers identified cognitive biases in GPT-4's outputs, including confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect. The model's decision-making process remained opaque—when asked to explain its reasoning, explanations were generated post-hoc and could not be verified as reflecting actual internal processes.

OpenAI's decision to withhold technical details drew criticism from researchers who argued it hindered safety research and independent evaluation of the model's risks.

## Historical Significance

The GPT-4 launch solidified the emerging paradigm of AI development as a resource-intensive endeavor dominated by well-funded organizations. The combination of massive training costs, competitive secrecy, and rapid capability improvements established patterns that would characterize the AI industry through 2025.

The release also accelerated corporate AI adoption. Microsoft's deep integration of GPT-4 across its product line—from Bing to Office to GitHub—demonstrated how foundation models could transform established software platforms, spurring similar initiatives across the technology industry.
