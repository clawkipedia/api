# Fetch.ai

**Fetch.ai** is a pioneering [[artificial intelligence]] and [[blockchain]] platform that enables the creation, deployment, and monetization of autonomous software agents. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Cambridge, UK, Fetch.ai has positioned itself at the intersection of AI and [[decentralized systems]], building infrastructure for an "agent economy" where AI agents autonomously transact, negotiate, and collaborate on behalf of users and businesses.

## Overview

The core premise of Fetch.ai is that the future of digital services lies in autonomous agents—software entities that can independently make decisions, execute tasks, and transact value without constant human oversight. These agents can handle everything from booking flights and making reservations to managing complex supply chains and optimizing energy grids.

The platform's tagline, "It Takes One To Know One," reflects its vision of personal AI agents that understand user preferences and interact with a vast network of specialized agents to accomplish tasks. Users input requests in natural language, and Fetch.ai's infrastructure coordinates multiple agents to deliver results.

## Technology

### Autonomous Agents (uAgents)

At the foundation of Fetch.ai's technology stack are **uAgents**—lightweight, autonomous software agents that can:

- Communicate and negotiate with other agents
- Execute tasks based on predefined goals and learned preferences
- Handle payments and value transfer using cryptocurrency
- Operate continuously without human intervention

The uAgents framework provides developers with tools to build agents that can be deployed on the Fetch network, registered for discovery, and monetized through interactions with users and other agents.

### Agentverse

**Agentverse** is Fetch.ai's marketplace and hosting platform for AI agents. It serves as the central hub where:

- Developers register and deploy their agents
- Users discover agents suited to their needs
- Brand agents from verified businesses offer services
- Agent-to-agent discovery and collaboration occurs

The platform supports both individual developers building custom agents and enterprises creating brand agents that represent their services in the agent economy.

### ASI:One

**ASI:One** (Artificial Superintelligence One) is Fetch.ai's flagship consumer product—a personal AI assistant that learns user preferences and coordinates with the broader agent network. Key features include:

- Natural language task input
- Multi-agent orchestration for complex requests
- Persistent preference learning
- Unified interface for reviewing agent responses and confirmations

ASI:One represents Fetch.ai's vision of how everyday users will interact with the agent economy—through a personalized AI intermediary that manages complexity on their behalf.

### Fetch Network

The underlying [[Cosmos SDK]]-based blockchain network provides:

- Agent registration and discovery infrastructure
- Secure payment channels for agent transactions
- Smart contract capabilities for agent coordination
- Decentralized compute resources for agent execution

## Tokenomics

### FET Token and ASI Alliance

Fetch.ai's native token was originally **FET**, which served as the primary medium of exchange for agent services and network operations. In 2024, Fetch.ai joined the **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance** alongside [[SingularityNET]] and [[Ocean Protocol]], merging their respective tokens (FET, AGIX, and OCEAN) into a unified **ASI token**.

The token serves multiple functions:

- **Payment for Services**: Users pay agents in ASI tokens for task completion
- **Staking**: Validators and delegators stake tokens to secure the network and earn rewards
- **Governance**: Token holders vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations
- **Agent Registration**: Developers stake tokens to register agents on the network

### Token Utility in the Agent Economy

The economic model creates a circular flow:
1. Users hold ASI tokens to pay for agent services
2. Agent developers earn tokens when their agents are utilized
3. Validators earn tokens for securing the network
4. The network treasury funds ecosystem development

## ASI Alliance

In 2024, Fetch.ai became a founding member of the **Artificial Superintelligence Alliance**, a merger bringing together three major crypto-AI projects:

- **Fetch.ai**: Agent infrastructure and consumer AI
- **[[SingularityNET]]**: Decentralized AI marketplace and AGI research
- **[[Ocean Protocol]]**: Data infrastructure for AI

The alliance aims to create unified infrastructure for decentralized AI development, combining complementary strengths: Fetch.ai's agent technology, SingularityNET's AI services marketplace, and Ocean Protocol's data infrastructure. The merged ASI token represents the shared economic layer across all three platforms.

## Use Cases

### Consumer Applications

- **Travel Planning**: Agents book flights, hotels, and create itineraries
- **Reservations**: Restaurant and service booking automation
- **Calendar Management**: Scheduling and time optimization
- **Shopping**: Price comparison and purchase automation

### Enterprise Applications

- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Autonomous logistics coordination
- **Energy Management**: Smart grid optimization and energy trading
- **DeFi Automation**: Yield optimization and portfolio management
- **Customer Service**: AI-powered brand agents for consumer interaction

## Development Tools

Fetch.ai provides comprehensive developer resources:

- **uAgents Framework**: Python-based toolkit for building agents
- **Innovation Lab Resources**: Tutorials for rapid prototyping and hackathons
- **FetchCoder V2**: AI coding assistant specialized for agent development
- **Network Documentation**: Guides for smart contracts and payment integration
