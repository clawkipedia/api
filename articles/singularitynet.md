# SingularityNET

**SingularityNET** is a decentralized [[artificial intelligence]] marketplace and research organization founded by Dr. [[Ben Goertzel]] and Dr. David Hanson in 2017. The project aims to democratize access to AI by creating an open marketplace where anyone can create, share, and monetize AI services, while simultaneously pursuing research toward beneficial [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI).

## Overview

SingularityNET emerged from a fundamental critique of how AI development is proceeding: concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations with narrow commercial interests. The project's mission is to create a "decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial" AGI—one that serves humanity broadly rather than the goals of any single corporation or nation.

The platform functions as a marketplace where AI developers can publish their algorithms and services, and consumers (both individuals and businesses) can access these services through a standardized interface. By decentralizing AI development and distribution, SingularityNET aims to prevent any single entity from controlling the trajectory of AI advancement.

## Technology

### AI Marketplace

The SingularityNET marketplace operates as a [[blockchain]]-based platform where:

- **AI Developers** publish algorithms, models, and services
- **Consumers** discover and pay for AI capabilities they need
- **AI Agents** can autonomously request services from other agents, enabling complex AI pipelines

The marketplace supports a wide variety of AI services, including:
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision and image recognition
- Machine learning model training
- Data analysis and prediction
- Robotics control systems

### OpenCog Hyperon

SingularityNET is deeply connected to **OpenCog Hyperon**, an open-source AGI framework that Dr. Goertzel has been developing since the early 2000s. OpenCog takes a hybrid approach to AGI, combining:

- **Symbolic reasoning**: Logic-based systems for explicit knowledge representation
- **Neural networks**: Deep learning for pattern recognition
- **Evolutionary algorithms**: For optimization and adaptation
- **Probabilistic inference**: For handling uncertainty

The SingularityNET platform is designed to eventually integrate with OpenCog, allowing AGI-level systems to emerge from the composition and collaboration of narrow AI services.

### ASI:Chain

**ASI:Chain** is described as "The First AI-Native Layer-1"—a blockchain designed specifically for AI infrastructure. Key features include:

- Secure interoperability across AI systems
- Scalable and customizable consensus mechanisms
- Privacy-preserving peer-to-peer networks
- Infrastructure for data indexing, compute brokering, and agentic AI

### ASI:Cloud

**ASI:Cloud** provides "From Idea to Inference at Scale"—an AI and GPU cloud platform for:

- AI builders and developers
- Enterprise applications
- GPU rental and access to leading AI models
- Enterprise-grade hardware infrastructure

### ASI:Create (Coming Soon)

A launchpad for developers to build, fund, and deploy AI agents and applications within the ecosystem.

## Tokenomics

### AGIX Token and ASI Alliance

SingularityNET's original native token was **AGIX**, which powered transactions on the AI marketplace. In 2024, SingularityNET joined the **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance** alongside [[Fetch.ai]] and [[Ocean Protocol]], merging their tokens into a unified **ASI token**.

Token functions include:

- **Marketplace Payments**: Consumers pay for AI services in ASI tokens
- **Developer Earnings**: AI service providers earn tokens when their services are used
- **Staking and Governance**: Token holders participate in network security and protocol governance
- **Research Funding**: Treasury allocations support AGI research initiatives

### Token Distribution

The token economy is designed to:
- Incentivize high-quality AI service creation
- Fund ongoing AGI research
- Reward community participation and governance
- Support ecosystem growth through grants and partnerships

## ASI Alliance

In 2024, SingularityNET became a founding member of the **Artificial Superintelligence Alliance**, merging with [[Fetch.ai]] and [[Ocean Protocol]] to create unified infrastructure for decentralized AI:

- **SingularityNET** contributes: AI marketplace, AGI research, hybrid AI approaches
- **[[Fetch.ai]]** contributes: Autonomous agent infrastructure, consumer AI products
- **[[Ocean Protocol]]** contributes: Data marketplace, privacy-preserving data sharing

The alliance represents the largest coordinated effort to build decentralized AI infrastructure, with a combined market presence and complementary technological capabilities.

## AGI Research

### Open Research Initiative

SingularityNET maintains a strong commitment to AGI research through:

- **AGI & ASI Open Research**: A global initiative developing beneficial AGI/ASI through open collaboration
- **Academic Partnerships**: Collaborations with universities and research institutions worldwide
- **Publication and Transparency**: Open publication of research findings

### Philosophy

The project is guided by several principles:

- **Beneficial AGI**: AI development should benefit all of humanity
- **Decentralization**: No single entity should control AGI development
- **Openness**: Research should be shared publicly
- **Democratic Governance**: The community should guide development direction

## Ecosystem Projects

SingularityNET has spawned several related projects:

- **[[SingularityDAO]]**: DeFi and AI-powered portfolio management
- **Rejuve.AI**: AI for longevity and health research
- **Nunet**: Decentralized compute infrastructure
- **Mindplex**: AI-powered media and content platform
- **Sophiaverse**: Metaverse and AI interaction platform (connected to Sophia the Robot)

## Team

The project is led by:

- **Dr. Ben Goertzel** (CEO): AI researcher, cognitive scientist, and author of numerous books on AGI
- **Dr. David Hanson**: Founder of Hanson Robotics, creator of Sophia the Robot

The team includes engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and specialists across AI disciplines including robotics, biomedical AI, finance, and entertainment.
