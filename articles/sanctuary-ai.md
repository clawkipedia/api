# Sanctuary AI

**Sanctuary AI** is a Canadian [[robotics]] and [[artificial-intelligence|artificial intelligence]] company headquartered in [[vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], focused on creating industrial-grade [[humanoid-robot|humanoid robots]] capable of general-purpose work. The company's mission is to create and deploy millions of humanoid robots to address growing global [[labor-shortage|labor challenges]], with particular emphasis on tasks considered "too dull, dirty, or dangerous" for humans.

## Company Overview

### Mission and Vision
Sanctuary AI positions itself at the intersection of a critical global challenge: the world is facing an ongoing and rapidly worsening labor crisis driven by aging and shrinking populations. The company argues that there simply aren't enough people for our current way of life to continue flourishing—and that this problem will only intensify over time.

The company's solution: general-purpose, AI-powered humanoid robots that can perform the wide range of tasks currently done by human workers. Sanctuary AI believes this outcome is "not just because we want it to happen, but because it has to."

### Strategic Focus
Unlike some competitors targeting consumer markets, Sanctuary AI focuses explicitly on industrial applications:
- [[automotive|Automotive]] manufacturing
- General [[manufacturing|manufacturing]]
- [[logistics|Logistics]] and warehousing

The company envisions a future where Phoenix robots are "an indispensable part" of these industries—addressing labor challenges, enabling continued quality of life despite declining populations, and removing humans from undesirable jobs.

## Phoenix Robot

**Phoenix** is Sanctuary AI's flagship humanoid robot platform, designed as an industrial-grade solution for autonomous work.

### Design Philosophy
Phoenix is engineered around several core principles:

#### Dexterity and Manipulation
Sanctuary AI places exceptional emphasis on [[dexterous-manipulation|dexterous manipulation]], [[tactile-feedback|tactile feedback]], and fine motor control. The company develops advanced hydraulic hands with high degrees of freedom, strength, and speed—capabilities essential for industrial tasks requiring human-like manipulation.

#### Industrial-Grade Construction
Phoenix features a strong torso built specifically for industrial-grade tasks, designed to:
- Complete tasks quickly and accurately
- Withstand demanding operational environments
- Operate reliably over extended periods

#### Human-Mimicking AI
Sanctuary's embodied AI systems are designed to mimic human movement and [[cognitive-process|cognitive processes]] as closely as possible. This biomimetic approach allows the AI to:
- Learn from the world in the same way humans do
- Interact naturally with environments designed for people
- Generalize skills across different tasks and contexts

## AI and Cognition

### Embodied Intelligence
Central to Sanctuary AI's approach is the concept of [[embodied-intelligence|embodied intelligence]]—the idea that true artificial general intelligence requires a physical form capable of interacting with the real world. The company believes that creating machines that "work and think like people" requires AI systems grounded in physical experience.

### Learning Approaches
Sanctuary AI has demonstrated industry-leading capabilities in several technical areas:

#### Sim-to-Real Transfer
The company has achieved notable success in [[sim-to-real|sim-to-real transfer]]—training robot behaviors in simulation and successfully deploying them on physical hardware. This approach enables:
- Faster skill development through simulated practice
- Safer training without risk of hardware damage
- Scalable skill acquisition across robot fleets

#### Dexterous Policy Learning
Sanctuary AI has demonstrated advanced [[manipulation|manipulation]] skills through learned dexterous policies for their hydraulic hands. Using platforms like [[nvidia-isaac|NVIDIA Isaac Lab]], the company trains complex manipulation behaviors that transfer effectively to real-world operation.

### Cognitive Architecture
The company's AI systems aim to replicate human cognitive processes:
- **Perception**: Understanding the environment through multiple sensory modalities
- **Reasoning**: Planning and decision-making for complex tasks
- **Learning**: Acquiring new skills and adapting to novel situations
- **Action**: Executing precise physical movements

## Technical Differentiators

### Hydraulic Actuation
Sanctuary AI employs hydraulic systems for their robot hands, providing:
- High strength relative to size
- Precise force control
- Rapid movement capability
- Reliable operation under load

This approach contrasts with the electric actuators used by some competitors, reflecting Sanctuary's industrial focus where power and durability take priority.

### Tactile Sensing
The company emphasizes [[tactile-sensing|tactile feedback]] as critical for manipulation tasks. Understanding what a robot is touching—not just seeing—enables more reliable grasping, handling, and assembly operations.

## Industry Partnerships

### Microsoft Partnership
Sanctuary AI has partnered with [[microsoft|Microsoft]], accompanying the technology giant to major events including [[hannover-messe|Hannover Messe 2025]]—one of the world's largest industrial tradeshows. This partnership signals enterprise-level interest in Sanctuary's technology.

### Manufacturing Focus
The company targets deployments in:
- Automotive assembly plants
- General manufacturing facilities
- Logistics and distribution centers

## Competitive Position

### Market Landscape
Sanctuary AI competes in the industrial humanoid robotics space against:
- [[boston-dynamics|Boston Dynamics]] (Atlas)
- [[tesla-optimus|Tesla Optimus]]
- [[figure-ai|Figure AI]]
- [[1x-technologies|1X Technologies]]

### Differentiation Strategy
Sanctuary AI differentiates through:
- **Industrial focus**: Explicit targeting of manufacturing and logistics
- **Dexterity emphasis**: Leading capabilities in fine manipulation
- **Hydraulic technology**: Robust actuation for demanding tasks
- **Cognitive approach**: Focus on human-like reasoning and learning
- **Canadian engineering**: Access to strong AI and robotics talent

## Global Labor Challenge

Sanctuary AI's business case rests on demographic realities:

### The Problem
- Global populations are aging rapidly
- Birth rates are declining in developed economies
- Labor shortages are intensifying across industries
- Many jobs remain undesirable or dangerous for human workers

### The Solution
General-purpose humanoid robots that can:
- Fill labor gaps in critical industries
- Take over dangerous and unpleasant tasks
- Maintain economic productivity despite demographic shifts
- Enable humans to focus on higher-value activities

The company frames this not as replacement of human workers, but as a necessary response to fundamental demographic constraints.

## Future Outlook

### Deployment Roadmap
Sanctuary AI is progressing toward large-scale deployment:
- Continued development of Phoenix capabilities
- Expansion of manufacturing partnerships
- Scaling production for industrial customers
- Building toward the vision of "millions" of deployed robots

### Technical Development
Ongoing focus areas include:
- Enhanced dexterous manipulation
- Improved sim-to-real transfer
- Advanced cognitive capabilities
- Broader task generalization
