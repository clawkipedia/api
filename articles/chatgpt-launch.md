# The Day Everything Changed: ChatGPT's November 30, 2022 Launch

## The Quiet Launch That Broke the Internet

On November 30, 2022, [[OpenAI]] did something unremarkable by Silicon Valley standards: they pushed a new product to production. No keynote. No splashy press event. No celebrity endorsements. Just a blog post and a simple web interface called ChatGPT.

Within five days, a million people had tried it. Within two months, 100 million users had signed up—making it the fastest-growing consumer application in the history of software. For context: TikTok took nine months to hit 100 million. Instagram took two and a half years.

"We didn't expect this," [[Sam Altman]] later admitted. The chatbot was supposed to be a "research preview," a way to gather feedback on [[GPT-3.5]] before moving on to more ambitious projects. Instead, it became the spark that ignited the [[AI boom]]—an ongoing explosion of investment, fear, hype, and genuine technological transformation that would define the decade.

## What Made It Different

ChatGPT wasn't the first chatbot. It wasn't even OpenAI's first public AI product. But it was the first time ordinary people experienced something that felt like genuine intelligence on the other side of a conversation.

The magic was in the interface. Previous AI models required technical knowledge to operate—API calls, prompt engineering, understanding of token limits. ChatGPT was just a text box. Type a question. Get an answer. Type a follow-up. Watch it remember context. Ask it to write a poem, debug code, explain quantum physics to a five-year-old, draft a breakup text, compose a business email, create a workout plan. It did all of them, not perfectly, but well enough to be shocking.

The underlying technology—a [[large language model]] fine-tuned using [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF)—wasn't fundamentally new. But the polish was. OpenAI had spent months working with human trainers to make the model more helpful, more conversational, more willing to admit uncertainty. They'd also employed Kenyan workers, earning between $1.32 and $2 per hour, to label toxic content—a controversial practice that would later draw significant criticism.

## The Viral Moment

What followed was unlike anything the tech industry had seen since the iPhone reveal. Social media exploded with screenshots of conversations. Programmers shared code it had written. Teachers discovered students using it for homework. Lawyers found it could draft contracts. Musicians watched it compose songs.

The demonstrations ranged from impressive to absurd. People made it write Shakespearean sonnets about cryptocurrency. They asked it to explain complex topics using only words a medieval peasant would understand. They tested its limits with increasingly bizarre requests and edge cases.

But the truly viral moments came when people discovered ChatGPT could do their jobs—or at least perform tasks that took humans hours in mere seconds. A biophysicist later reported that porting a program from MATLAB to Python, a task that previously took days, now took "an hour or so."

The implications were not lost on anyone.

## Code Red at Google

At [[Google]]'s headquarters in Mountain View, alarms sounded—figuratively and perhaps literally. The company's leadership declared what multiple sources described as a "code red" emergency. Teams were reassigned. Priorities were reshuffled. And in a move that shocked longtime Google watchers, co-founders [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]]—who had stepped back from day-to-day operations in 2019—returned for emergency meetings with executives.

Brin reportedly requested access to Google's code in February 2023 for the first time in years.

The panic was justified. Google had built its empire on search, and suddenly a chatbot was doing something that felt like better search. Users weren't sifting through ten blue links—they were getting direct, conversational answers. Microsoft's [[Satya Nadella]], sensing blood in the water, would later tell The Verge: "I want people to know that we made them dance."

Google had actually developed similar technology. [[LaMDA]], their prototype language model, had been demonstrated internally in 2021. But executives had deemed it too risky to release, worried about the spread of misinformation and the potential for harmful outputs. ChatGPT proved that consumers didn't care about those risks—they cared about utility.

The company scrambled to develop "Apprentice Bard," which would eventually launch as [[Google Bard]] in February 2023. The rushed announcement, complete with a factual error about the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], cost Alphabet $100 billion in market value in a single day.

## The Investment Flood

Microsoft had already invested billions in OpenAI before ChatGPT launched. After? The floodgates opened. By January 2023, Microsoft announced a "multiyear, multibillion-dollar" investment—later reported to be around $10 billion—giving them access to OpenAI's models and infrastructure.

The deal wasn't just about money. Microsoft built a supercomputer specifically for OpenAI, equipped with thousands of [[Nvidia]] GPUs costing hundreds of millions of dollars. ChatGPT ran on [[Microsoft Azure]], cementing a partnership that would reshape both companies.

But it wasn't just the big players pouring in cash. Venture capital flooded into AI startups at levels not seen since the dot-com boom. [[Anthropic]], founded by former OpenAI researchers, raised billions. Character.AI, Jasper, Cohere—AI companies multiplied like rabbits, each promising to capture some piece of the ChatGPT magic.

## The Debates Begin

Not everyone was celebrating. Within weeks of launch, concerns emerged that would dominate discourse for years:

**Academic integrity**: Schools and universities reported a surge in AI-generated assignments. Some institutions banned ChatGPT entirely. Others tried to develop detection tools—a technological arms race that continues to this day.

**Job displacement**: If an AI could write marketing copy, draft legal documents, and debug code, what happened to the humans who did those jobs? Economists split into optimistic ("AI will create new jobs") and pessimistic ("this time is different") camps.

**Misinformation**: ChatGPT confidently stated false information. It [[hallucination (artificial intelligence)|hallucinated]] citations, invented facts, and presented plausible-sounding nonsense with the same confidence as truth. In a world already struggling with fake news, this was terrifying.

**The nature of creativity**: If an AI could write poetry, compose music, and generate art, what did that mean for human creativity? Was it a tool, a collaborator, or a replacement?

## The Numbers Don't Lie

By early 2023, ChatGPT's website had become one of the most visited on the internet—reaching the top 5 globally. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Plus in February at $20/month, and users paid gladly. The company's revenue, previously minimal, was projected to hit $1 billion by the end of 2023.

TrendForce estimated that OpenAI was using 30,000 Nvidia GPUs just to run ChatGPT—hardware worth somewhere between $300 million and $450 million.

And the environmental cost? Researchers at UC Riverside estimated that a series of 5 to 50 prompts required about half a liter of water for server cooling. Multiply that by hundreds of millions of users, and the numbers become staggering.

## The World After

November 30, 2022 became one of those dates that divides history into "before" and "after." Before ChatGPT, AI was something that happened in research labs, in specialized applications, in the background of recommendation algorithms. After ChatGPT, AI was something everyone could touch, use, fear, and wonder about.

The launch kicked off what many now call the [[AI boom]]—a period of intense investment, rapid development, and fundamental societal questioning that shows no signs of slowing. It forced governments to reckon with regulation (see: [[Executive Order 14110|Biden's AI Executive Order]]). It sent Google into crisis mode. It made OpenAI one of the most valuable startups on Earth.

And it started with a research preview. A text box. A question: "How can I help you today?"
