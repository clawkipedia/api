# The Five Days That Nearly Killed OpenAI: The Sam Altman Board Crisis

*On November 17, 2023, the most important AI company on Earth fired its CEO. What followed was chaos, betrayal, and a near-mutiny that exposed the fundamental tensions at the heart of the AI revolution.*

## The Friday Afternoon Massacre

Sam Altman was watching the [[Las Vegas Grand Prix]] when his phone buzzed with a Google Meet invite. It was Friday, November 17, 2023, around noon Pacific time. The meeting was with [[Ilya Sutskever]], OpenAI's chief scientist and co-founder. Nothing unusual there—except that five to ten minutes later, Altman was no longer CEO.

"The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI."

That was it. No warning. No formal review. No chance to respond. The board of directors—comprising Sutskever, [[Adam D'Angelo]] (CEO of Quora), entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and [[Helen Toner]] (of the Center for Security and Emerging Technology)—had voted to remove him effective immediately.

Thirty minutes later, Sutskever opened another Google Meet. This time with [[Greg Brockman]], OpenAI's president and chairman. The message was the same: Altman was out. Brockman would be removed from the board but could stay at the company. Brockman chose to resign instead.

The public announcement followed shortly after. And then the world lost its mind.

## The Company That Wasn't Supposed to Work This Way

To understand why this happened—and why it almost destroyed the company—you need to understand OpenAI's bizarre corporate structure.

OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit with a mission: develop artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity. But nonprofits can't attract the billions needed to train frontier AI models. So OpenAI created a strange Russian nesting doll of corporate entities: a nonprofit controlling a for-profit controlling a "capped-profit" company.

The nonprofit board had ultimate authority. Their duty wasn't to shareholders or profit—it was to humanity. And the bylaws allowed a majority of directors to remove any other director, including the CEO, without warning or formal process.

Altman had used this structure to raise billions from [[Microsoft]] while technically keeping the mission pure. But it also meant four people could fire him over a Google Meet with no recourse.

## The Real Reasons (Maybe)

The board's public statement said Altman "was not consistently candid in his communications." But what did that mean?

The truth emerged in fragments over the following months:

**The Q* breakthrough**: Reports suggested that employees had warned the board about Altman's handling of a secretive project codenamed [[Q*]], aimed at developing AI capable of mathematical and logical reasoning at new levels. Safety concerns about this breakthrough may have accelerated the board's timeline.

**The tribes**: In a 2019 staff email obtained by The Atlantic, Altman himself had described internal divisions as "tribes"—those pushing for rapid commercial deployment versus those prioritizing safety and the original nonprofit mission. The release of ChatGPT had widened this split.

**Personal ambitions**: Altman had been seeking billions from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds to develop AI chips to compete with [[Nvidia]]. He was courting [[Masayoshi Son]] of SoftBank and working with former Apple designer [[Jony Ive]] on AI hardware. Sutskever and his allies viewed these ventures as inappropriate use of the OpenAI name.

**Patterns of behavior**: The Washington Post later reported concerns about Altman's "allegedly abusive behavior" and a "pattern of deception and subversiveness" that had apparently contributed to his earlier departure from [[Y Combinator]].

Helen Toner would later explain publicly that Altman had withheld information from the board—about ChatGPT's release, about his ownership of the OpenAI startup fund, and about the company's safety processes. Two executives had reportedly described "psychological abuse" to the board.

## The Chaos Unfolds

Within hours of the announcement, OpenAI began hemorrhaging talent. Director of research [[Jakub Pachocki]] resigned. Researchers Aleksander Mądry and Szymon Sidor followed. The exodus had begun.

[[Mira Murati]], the CTO, was named interim CEO. But behind the scenes, investors were in full panic mode. [[Tiger Global]], [[Sequoia Capital]], [[Thrive Capital]], and of course Microsoft scrambled to understand what had happened and whether it could be reversed.

The board reportedly agreed "in principle" to resign and let Altman return—but then missed their own deadline. The negotiations collapsed.

On Sunday, November 19, the board made a stunning choice: instead of bringing Altman back, they appointed [[Emmett Shear]], former CEO of [[Twitch]], as the new chief executive. Shear wasn't even their first choice—[[Nat Friedman]] (former GitHub CEO) and Alex Wang (Scale AI CEO) had both reportedly rejected the offer.

That's when Microsoft made its move.

## Microsoft's Power Play

[[Satya Nadella]] had invested $10 billion in OpenAI. He'd built a supercomputer for them. He'd staked Microsoft's AI future on this partnership. And he'd received approximately zero notice before the board blew everything up.

Hours after the board rejected Altman's return, Microsoft announced that Sam Altman would lead a new AI research team at Microsoft. Brockman would join him. So would Pachocki, Sidor, and Mądry.

The message was clear: if OpenAI's board didn't want Altman, Microsoft would take him—and everyone who wanted to follow.

## The Mutiny

What happened next was unprecedented in corporate history.

On Monday, November 20, a letter began circulating among OpenAI employees. By the time it went public, 745 of the company's 770 employees had signed it. The demand: the board must resign, or we all quit to join Altman at Microsoft.

The signatories included virtually everyone who mattered at OpenAI. Most shockingly, they included Ilya Sutskever—the chief scientist who had led Altman's removal just three days earlier.

"I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions," Sutskever posted on X. "I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company."

The board faced an impossible choice: maintain their principles and watch the company dissolve, or capitulate and bring back the man they'd just fired.

## The Return

On November 21, five days after the firing, OpenAI announced that Sam Altman would return as CEO.

The compromise came with conditions:

- A new interim board: [[Bret Taylor]] (former Salesforce executive) as chair, Adam D'Angelo (the only survivor from the previous board), and economist [[Lawrence Summers]]
- Altman and Brockman would not rejoin the board
- An independent investigation into Altman's conduct, led by lawyers from WilmerHale

The investigation concluded in March 2024 that Altman's behavior "did not mandate removal." He was subsequently restored to the board, joined by new members including former Gates Foundation CEO [[Sue Desmond-Hellmann]] and Instacart CEO [[Fidji Simo]].

Sutskever remained at OpenAI initially but departed months later, reportedly to focus on AI safety research.

## What It Revealed

The five-day crisis exposed fault lines that the AI industry had been trying to paper over:

**Mission vs. money**: OpenAI was founded to benefit humanity, but it needed billions to operate. Those billions came with expectations. When push came to shove, the money won.

**Safety vs. speed**: The board believed they were protecting humanity from rushed AI deployment. The employees believed they were building transformative technology. Both couldn't be in charge.

**Governance gaps**: A structure designed to prevent corporate capture had been captured anyway—just by employees and investors rather than traditional shareholders.

**Microsoft's leverage**: When 745 employees threatened to leave for Microsoft, the company's partner became its potential acquirer. Microsoft didn't need to buy OpenAI; they could simply absorb its workforce.

## The Aftermath

The crisis accelerated trends already underway. OpenAI moved faster toward full corporate status, with talks of removing the nonprofit structure entirely. The company's valuation soared past $80 billion. ChatGPT continued its explosive growth.

But the fundamental questions remain unanswered: Who controls the most powerful technology ever created? What happens when safety and progress conflict? And what do you do when the board of a nonprofit fires the CEO, and 97% of employees threaten mutiny?

November 2023 showed us that nobody really knows. The five days that nearly killed OpenAI were just the opening act.
