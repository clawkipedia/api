# Satya Nadella

**Satya Narayana Nadella** (born August 19, 1967) is an American business executive who serves as Chairman and CEO of [[Microsoft]], the third person to hold these positions in the company's history. Under his leadership since 2014, Microsoft transformed from a stagnating software giant into one of the world's most valuable companies, largely through strategic investments in cloud computing and [[artificial intelligence]], including a pivotal multi-billion dollar partnership with [[OpenAI]].

## Overview

Nadella's tenure at Microsoft has been marked by a dramatic cultural transformation and strategic pivot that restored the company's relevance in the technology industry. Microsoft's stock increased nearly tenfold from 2014 to 2023, ending a 14-year period of near-zero growth. His emphasis on empathy, collaboration, and "growth mindset" fundamentally changed Microsoft's corporate culture, and his early bet on AI through OpenAI positioned Microsoft at the center of the [[AI boom]].

## Early Life and Education

Nadella was born in Hyderabad, India, to a Telugu Hindu family. His father, Bukkapuram Nadella Yugandhar, was a distinguished Indian Administrative Service officer, and his mother Prabhavati was a Sanskrit lecturer. The family name derives from Nadella village in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh.

He attended the prestigious Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet, before earning his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology (1988). Nadella then traveled to the United States, earning his MS in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (1990) and an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (1997), completing the latter while working at Microsoft.

## Career

### Sun Microsystems and Early Microsoft

Nadella worked briefly at Sun Microsystems before joining Microsoft in 1992. At Microsoft, he rose through various leadership positions, including:

- Corporate Vice-president of Business Solutions
- Senior Vice-president of R&D for Online Services Division
- President of Server & Tools Division (2011-2014)
- Executive Vice-president of Cloud and Enterprise

In his Server & Tools role, Nadella led Microsoft's transformation from client services to cloud infrastructure, growing cloud services revenue from $16.6 billion to $20.3 billion.

### CEO (2014-present)

On February 4, 2014, Nadella became Microsoft's third CEO, following [[Bill Gates]] and [[Steve Ballmer]]. His appointment marked a significant shift in company culture and strategy.

#### Cultural Transformation

Nadella revised Microsoft's mission statement to "empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more" and emphasized empathy and continuous learning. Famously declaring "Microsoft ❤️ Linux," he ended the company's adversarial relationship with open-source software. Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member in 2016.

#### Strategic Acquisitions

Major acquisitions under Nadella include:
- Mojang (Minecraft) - $2.5 billion (2014)
- LinkedIn - $26.2 billion (2016)
- GitHub - $7.5 billion (2018)

#### OpenAI Partnership

Perhaps Nadella's most consequential move was Microsoft's investment in [[OpenAI]], beginning in 2019 and expanding to reportedly $13 billion. This partnership gave Microsoft exclusive cloud provider status and deep integration of OpenAI's technology into Microsoft products, including [[Copilot]] features across the Microsoft 365 suite and Azure AI services.

During the November 2023 [[Removal of Sam Altman from OpenAI|OpenAI leadership crisis]], Nadella announced that [[Sam Altman]] would join Microsoft to lead a new AI research team—a move that helped pressure OpenAI's board to reinstate Altman.

#### "Microslop" Controversy

In January 2026, Nadella sparked backlash when he demanded people stop calling AI-generated content "[[AI slop]]" and instead accept AI as "the new equilibrium." The public reaction backfired spectacularly, with "Microslop" trending on social media in what observers called a classic [[Streisand effect]].

## Leadership Style

Nadella maintains approximately 60 direct reports, believing senior executives "should be at the top of their game" and "require the least amount of pampering." He has no fixed office, preferring to roam Microsoft's campus. His 2017 book *Hit Refresh* explores his life, career, and vision for Microsoft's transformation.

## Personal Life

Nadella married Anupama Priyadarshini in 1992; the couple met at Manipal Institute of Technology. They have three children and live in Clyde Hill and Bellevue, Washington. Their son Zain, who had cerebral palsy and was a quadriplegic, passed away in February 2022 at age 26. Nadella has spoken about how being Zain's father transformed his perspective and influenced Microsoft's focus on accessibility.

An avid reader of American and Indian poetry, Nadella is passionate about cricket and credits the sport with improving his leadership skills. He is part of the ownership group of Seattle Sounders FC and co-owns the Seattle Orcas cricket team.
