# Figure AI

**Figure AI** (commonly stylized as **Figure**) is an American [[artificial-intelligence|artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] company focused on developing general-purpose [[humanoid-robot|humanoid robots]] for domestic and commercial applications. Founded in 2022, the company has rapidly emerged as one of the leading players in the humanoid robotics industry, distinguished by its partnership with [[OpenAI]] and its proprietary AI system, Helix.

## Company Overview

Figure AI was founded with the ambitious goal of creating humanoid robots capable of performing everyday tasks in human environments. The company's mission centers on building robots that can seamlessly integrate into homes, workplaces, and commercial settings, addressing labor shortages and enabling humans to focus on higher-value activities.

The company attracted significant attention and investment from major technology firms and venture capital. Its partnership with [[OpenAI]], announced in early 2024, marked a pivotal moment in the humanoid robotics industry, combining Figure's hardware expertise with OpenAI's advanced [[large-language-model|large language models]] and [[artificial-general-intelligence|artificial general intelligence]] research capabilities.

## Figure 03

Figure's flagship product, the **Figure 03**, represents the company's third-generation humanoid robot designed specifically for home environments. Marketed as "the future of home help," Figure 03 is a general-purpose humanoid robot intended for everyday domestic use.

The robot features a human-shaped form factor optimized for navigating residential spaces and performing household tasks. Its design philosophy emphasizes familiarity and approachability, with proportions and movement patterns that mirror human capabilities, enabling it to operate within environments designed for people.

Key features of Figure 03 include:

- **Bipedal locomotion** capable of navigating complex home environments
- **Dexterous manipulation** for handling everyday objects
- **Human-scale design** allowing interaction with standard furniture and appliances
- **Autonomous operation** with minimal supervision required

## Helix AI System

At the core of Figure's robots lies **Helix**, the company's proprietary [[vision-language-action-model|Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model]]. Helix represents a significant advancement in robotic intelligence, functioning as a generalist AI system that enables the robot to learn, adapt, and improve over time as it acquires new skills.

### Architecture and Capabilities

Helix is designed to reason like a human, controlling the complete perception-action loop: perception, movement, and reasoning—all processed on-board and in real-time. This integrated approach enables Figure 03 to consider and perform tasks autonomously without following pre-scripted routines.

The AI system distinguishes itself through several key characteristics:

- **End-to-end learning**: Helix handles the entire cognitive pipeline from visual input to physical action
- **Real-time processing**: All computation occurs locally on the robot, enabling responsive behavior
- **Skill generalization**: Knowledge learned in one context can transfer to novel situations
- **Continuous improvement**: The system learns and improves from operational experience

### Technical Foundation

Helix builds upon recent advances in [[transformer-architecture|transformer architectures]] and [[multimodal-learning|multimodal learning]], combining vision processing, natural language understanding, and motor control into a unified framework. This approach mirrors developments in foundation models for [[computer-vision|computer vision]] and [[natural-language-processing|natural language processing]], adapted for embodied applications.

## Strategic Partnerships

Figure AI's collaboration with [[OpenAI]] represents one of the most significant partnerships in the humanoid robotics space. This alliance combines Figure's expertise in robotic hardware and embodied systems with OpenAI's world-leading research in [[machine-learning|machine learning]] and language models.

The partnership has enabled Figure to integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities into its robots, including natural language interaction, complex reasoning, and advanced task planning. Videos demonstrating Figure robots conversing naturally with humans and performing complex multi-step tasks have showcased the potential of this collaboration.

## Industry Position

Figure AI operates in an increasingly competitive market alongside companies like [[boston-dynamics|Boston Dynamics]], [[tesla-optimus|Tesla (Optimus)]], [[1x-technologies|1X Technologies]], and [[sanctuary-ai|Sanctuary AI]]. The company differentiates itself through its focus on home environments, its advanced AI integration, and its rapid development timeline.

The humanoid robotics market is projected to grow substantially through the 2030s, driven by aging populations, labor shortages, and advances in [[artificial-intelligence|AI]] and [[actuator]] technology. Figure AI's positioning in the domestic market places it at the forefront of what many analysts consider the next major platform shift in consumer technology.

## Future Outlook

Figure AI continues to develop and refine its robots for broader deployment. The company's roadmap includes expanding the capabilities of Figure 03, enhancing Helix's learning abilities, and scaling manufacturing to meet anticipated demand.

As the company moves toward commercial deployment, key challenges include ensuring safety in unstructured home environments, building consumer trust in robotic assistants, and achieving price points accessible to mainstream consumers.
