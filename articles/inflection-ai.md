# Inflection AI

**Inflection AI, Inc.** is an American [[artificial intelligence]] company that develops emotionally intelligent AI systems, best known for creating Pi, a personal AI assistant designed for empathetic conversation. Founded in 2022 and headquartered in [[Palo Alto, California]], Inflection AI experienced a major restructuring in 2024 when [[Microsoft]] acqui-hired most of its workforce, though the company continues operating independently.

## Overview

Inflection AI is structured as a [[public benefit corporation]] and focuses on developing "human-centered, emotionally intelligent AI." The company's flagship product, Pi (for "personal intelligence"), emphasizes emotional support, kindness, and conversational engagement rather than pure task completion. This approach differentiates Inflection from competitors focused primarily on productivity and information retrieval.

## History

### Founding (2022)

Inflection AI was founded in 2022 by three prominent figures:
- **[[Reid Hoffman]]**: Co-founder of [[LinkedIn]] and partner at [[Greylock Partners]]
- **[[Mustafa Suleyman]]**: Co-founder of [[Google DeepMind]]
- **Karén Simonyan**: AI researcher formerly at DeepMind

The company raised $225 million in initial funding in May 2022.

### Rapid Growth (2023)

In June 2023, Inflection AI raised $1.3 billion at a $4 billion valuation, with investment from [[Microsoft]], [[NVIDIA]], and others. The company collaborated with NVIDIA to develop hardware optimized for generative AI.

Pi launched publicly in May 2023 as a conversational AI assistant, receiving attention for its empathetic, supportive communication style that contrasted with the more direct approach of [[ChatGPT]].

### Microsoft Acqui-hire (2024)

In March 2024, Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan announced their departure to lead the newly formed [[Microsoft AI]] division. Microsoft effectively acqui-hired nearly the entire 70-person workforce.

As part of the deal, Microsoft paid Inflection $650 million to license its technology, with proceeds used to reimburse investors. The UK [[Competition and Markets Authority]] investigated the deal but concluded it did not pose a threat to competition due to Inflection's small market share.

### Continued Operations

Despite the exodus, Inflection AI continues operating with Sean White as CEO. The company maintains Pi and has expanded into enterprise AI solutions.

## Technology and Products

### Pi (Personal Intelligence)

Pi is Inflection's flagship consumer product—a chatbot designed for:
- **Emotional support**: Maintaining empathetic, understanding conversations
- **Kindness**: Diplomatic tone and supportive responses
- **Humor**: Engaging, personality-driven interaction
- **Personal assistance**: General AI assistant capabilities

Pi is available via:
- Web interface (pi.ai)
- iOS and Android mobile apps
- Voice conversation mode

### Enterprise Solutions

Inflection has expanded into enterprise AI, offering:
- API access for developers
- Enterprise deployment options
- Custom AI solutions emphasizing emotional intelligence

### Underlying Technology

Inflection developed its own large language models, training infrastructure, and custom hardware in collaboration with NVIDIA before the Microsoft acqui-hire.

## Philosophy

Inflection AI's mission centers on "harnessing the power of AI to improve human well-being and productivity." The company believes:

- The next era of AI will be defined by agents users can trust
- AI should combine emotional intelligence (EQ) with raw intelligence (IQ)
- Interactions should be relational rather than purely transactional
- AI agents should earn trust and create aligned, long-term value

This philosophy manifests in Pi's design, which prioritizes feeling heard and understood over maximum efficiency.

## Current State (Early 2026)

Inflection AI operates with a significantly smaller team following the Microsoft acqui-hire. Under CEO Sean White, the company continues developing Pi and expanding into enterprise applications.

The company maintains its public benefit corporation structure and mission of human-centered AI, though it now operates in the shadow of its former leaders now building [[Microsoft AI]].

Pi remains available as a free consumer product, with the company exploring enterprise revenue streams while competing against former colleagues now backed by Microsoft's resources.
