# ElevenLabs

**ElevenLabs** is a Polish-American [[artificial intelligence]] company specializing in voice synthesis, audio generation, and conversational AI. Founded in 2022 and headquartered in New York City with significant operations in Poland, ElevenLabs has become the industry leader in realistic [[text-to-speech]] technology and has expanded into voice agents, speech recognition, and multimodal creative tools.

## History

ElevenLabs was founded in 2022 by **Piotr Dabkowski** and **Mateusz Staniszewski**, former engineers at [[Google]] and [[Palantir Technologies]] respectively. The founders, both originally from Poland, were motivated by the poor quality of Polish dubbing in foreign films—a limitation they attributed to the high cost and limited availability of voice actors for smaller language markets.

The company launched its first voice synthesis model in early 2023, quickly gaining attention for producing remarkably natural-sounding speech that surpassed existing commercial offerings. The technology's quality, combined with an accessible API and generous free tier, drove rapid adoption among content creators, developers, and enterprises.

### Funding and Valuation

ElevenLabs has raised substantial venture capital, becoming one of the fastest-growing AI startups globally:

- **Seed Round (2023)**: $2 million from [[Credo Ventures]] and angel investors
- **Series A (2023)**: $19 million led by [[Andreessen Horowitz]] and [[Nat Friedman]]
- **Series B (2024)**: $80 million at a reported $1.1 billion valuation, achieving [[unicorn]] status
- **Series C (2025)**: Additional funding bringing valuation to approximately $3 billion

Investors include Andreessen Horowitz, [[Sequoia Capital]], [[Smash Capital]], and prominent technology executives.

## Technology

ElevenLabs' voice synthesis technology employs advanced [[neural network]] architectures trained on extensive voice datasets. The system excels at capturing subtle prosodic features—intonation, rhythm, stress, and emotion—that distinguish natural speech from robotic synthesis.

Key technical capabilities include:
- **Voice cloning**: Create custom voices from short audio samples
- **Cross-lingual synthesis**: Maintain voice characteristics across different languages
- **Emotional control**: Adjust vocal emotion and delivery style
- **Real-time processing**: Sub-100ms latency for conversational applications

## Safety and Ethics

ElevenLabs maintains a dedicated safety team combining research, engineering, and policy expertise. The company has implemented multi-layered safeguards to prevent misuse:
- Voice verification for cloning features
- Content moderation systems
- Watermarking for generated audio
- Usage monitoring and enforcement
- Cooperation with researchers on deepfake detection

### ElevenLabs Impact Program

The company provides free licenses through its Impact program to:
- Individuals with accessibility needs (visual impairment, speech disabilities)
- Nonprofit organizations in healthcare, education, and cultural sectors
