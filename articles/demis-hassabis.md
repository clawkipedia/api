# Demis Hassabis

**Sir Demis Hassabis** CBE FRS (born 27 July 1976) is a British artificial intelligence researcher, entrepreneur, and former video game designer who co-founded and serves as CEO of [[Google DeepMind]]. In 2024, he was jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on AI-powered protein structure prediction, cementing his status as one of the most accomplished AI researchers in history.

## Overview

Hassabis represents a rare combination of world-class expertise across multiple domains: a child chess prodigy, pioneering game designer, neuroscientist, and AI researcher. His company DeepMind has produced landmark achievements including [[AlphaGo]], which defeated world champion Go players, and [[AlphaFold]], which solved the 50-year grand challenge of protein structure prediction. He was knighted in 2024 for his contributions to AI and was named among Time's 2025 "Architects of AI" for Person of the Year.

## Early Life and Education

Hassabis was born in London to a Greek Cypriot father and a Chinese Singaporean mother. A child prodigy in chess, he achieved master standard (Elo 2300) at age 13 and captained several England junior chess teams. At age eight, he purchased his first computer—a ZX Spectrum 48K—with chess winnings and taught himself to program, eventually creating his first AI program on a Commodore Amiga to play the board game reversi.

He attended Queen Elizabeth's School, Barnet, completed his A-levels two years early at age 16, and earned a double first in Computer Science from Queens' College, Cambridge in 1997. He later obtained his PhD in cognitive neuroscience from UCL in 2009, supervised by [[Eleanor Maguire]], seeking inspiration from the human brain for new AI algorithms.

## Career

### Video Games (1992-2005)

Hassabis began his games career at [[Bullfrog Productions]] at age 17, co-designing and lead-programming *Theme Park* (1994) with [[Peter Molyneux]]. The simulation game sold millions of copies and inspired an entire genre. He later worked at Lionhead Studios as lead AI programmer on *Black & White* before founding Elixir Studios, which produced *Republic: The Revolution* and *Evil Genius*.

### Neuroscience Research

Following Elixir's closure, Hassabis returned to academia, completing his PhD and conducting postdoctoral research at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL. His neuroscience work was groundbreaking—his research showing that patients with hippocampal damage cannot imagine new experiences was listed among Science magazine's Top 10 Breakthroughs of the Year in 2007.

### DeepMind (2010-present)

In 2010, Hassabis co-founded [[DeepMind]] with [[Shane Legg]] and [[Mustafa Suleyman]], with the mission to "solve intelligence" and then use it "to solve everything else." The company attracted investments from tech luminaries and was acquired by Google for £400 million in 2014.

#### AlphaGo

DeepMind's [[AlphaGo]] program achieved what many considered impossible: defeating world champion Go players. Go had been considered a "holy grail" of AI due to its astronomical number of possible positions. AlphaGo defeated European champion Fan Hui 5-0 in 2015, former world champion Lee Sedol 4-1 in March 2016, and world #1 Ke Jie 3-0 in 2017.

#### AlphaFold

Perhaps DeepMind's most significant achievement is [[AlphaFold]], which tackled protein structure prediction—understanding how proteins fold into 3D shapes based on their amino acid sequences. AlphaFold 2 (2020) achieved accuracy competitive with experimental methods, leading Science magazine to declare the problem "essentially solved." DeepMind subsequently folded all 200 million known proteins and made the database freely available, transforming biological research worldwide.

### Isomorphic Labs

In 2021, Hassabis founded [[Isomorphic Labs]], an Alphabet subsidiary focused on using AI for drug discovery, which he also leads as CEO.

## Nobel Prize

In October 2024, Hassabis and [[John Jumper]] were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on AlphaFold, sharing the prize with [[David Baker]] for related work on computational protein design. This recognition placed AI research at the pinnacle of scientific achievement.

## Views on AI

Hassabis has been vocal about both AI's potential benefits and risks. In 2023, he signed the statement that "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war." However, he believes the technology's potential benefits for health and climate make continued development worthwhile, while emphasizing urgent need for AI safety research and evaluation frameworks.
