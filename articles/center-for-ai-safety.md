# Center for AI Safety

The **Center for AI Safety (CAIS)** is an American nonprofit organization headquartered in San Francisco that works to reduce catastrophic and existential risks from [[artificial intelligence]]. Founded in 2022 by [[Dan Hendrycks]] and Oliver Zhang, CAIS conducts technical [[ai-safety]] research, provides infrastructure to support the safety research community, and advocates for responsible AI development policies.

## Overview

CAIS operates under the premise that AI risk ranks alongside pandemics and nuclear war as a global priority, yet remains remarkably neglected relative to the pace of AI capability development. The organization works across three pillars: advancing safety research, building the safety research community, and promoting safety standards. CAIS emphasizes that technical work alone will not solve AI safety, prioritizing real-world policy impact alongside research.

## History

CAIS was founded in 2022 by Dan Hendrycks, a researcher known for work on machine learning robustness and safety benchmarks, and Oliver Zhang. The organization gained significant public attention in May 2023 when it published the "Statement on AI Risk of Extinction"—a single-sentence warning that became one of the most widely signed statements in AI history.

In 2023, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX (which had declared bankruptcy in November 2022) attempted to recover $6.5 million that it had donated to CAIS earlier that year as part of broader clawback proceedings.

## Statement on AI Risk of Extinction

In May 2023, CAIS released a brief statement declaring: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."

The statement was signed by hundreds of AI researchers and professors, as well as executives from major AI companies. Notable signatories included:
- Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI
- Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind
- Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic
- Geoffrey Hinton, "Godfather of AI" and Nobel laureate
- Yoshua Bengio, Turing Award winner
- Numerous professors from leading universities

The statement's brevity was intentional—allowing diverse signatories to agree on the core message without debating specific claims about timelines, mechanisms, or policy responses.

## Research

CAIS researchers have published influential work on AI risks and safety:

### Catastrophic AI Risk Analysis

The paper "An Overview of Catastrophic AI Risks" provides a comprehensive taxonomy of potential harms from advanced AI systems. It examines risks including:
- Use of AI in autonomous warfare
- AI-assisted engineering of pandemics and biological weapons
- AI capabilities for deception and manipulation
- Cybersecurity threats from AI-powered hacking
- Loss of control over advanced AI systems

### Adversarial Robustness

In collaboration with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, CAIS published work demonstrating automated methods to discover adversarial attacks against large language models. The research revealed that current safety measures could be systematically bypassed, with attack methods transferring across different models—highlighting fundamental inadequacies in deployed safety systems.

### Safety Benchmarks

CAIS has contributed to developing benchmarks for evaluating AI safety properties, including robustness to distribution shift, anomaly detection capabilities, and alignment with human preferences.

## Programs and Initiatives

### Compute Cluster

CAIS operates a compute cluster available to AI safety researchers, addressing the infrastructure gap that can limit independent safety research. This democratizes access to the computational resources needed to study and evaluate large models.

### ML Safety Course

CAIS offers "Intro to ML Safety," an online course introducing machine learning practitioners to safety concepts and research directions. The course covers robustness, monitoring, alignment, and systemic safety.

### Philosophy Fellowship

Recognizing that AI safety involves deep conceptual questions, CAIS runs a fellowship program for philosophy professors to address foundational problems in the field.

## Policy Advocacy

CAIS has engaged in AI policy advocacy, most notably through the Center for AI Safety Action Fund. This affiliated organization was a primary sponsor of California's SB 1047, the "Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act"—landmark legislation that would have established safety requirements for the most powerful AI systems developed or deployed in California.

## Leadership

- **Dan Hendrycks** (Executive Director): ML researcher known for creating widely-used robustness benchmarks (ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R) and safety evaluation tools. Previously conducted research at UC Berkeley.
- **Oliver Zhang** (Co-founder): Focused on operational and strategic aspects of the organization.

## Current State (2025-2026)

CAIS has grown into one of the most influential AI safety organizations, particularly in bridging technical research and policy advocacy. The organization continues to publish research, support the safety research community through grants and infrastructure, and engage with policymakers on AI governance frameworks.

The extinction risk statement's wide signature list—including leaders from competing AI companies agreeing on the severity of the problem—remains a significant moment in public discourse about AI safety.
