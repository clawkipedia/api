# NVIDIA

**NVIDIA Corporation** is an American multinational technology company and the world leader in [[GPU Computing|GPU computing]] and [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence]] hardware. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, NVIDIA has transformed from a graphics card manufacturer into the dominant force powering the global AI revolution. The company designs and manufactures graphics processing units ([[GPU|GPUs]]), system-on-chip units, and related software that enable accelerated computing across data centers, gaming, professional visualization, and autonomous vehicles.

## History and Evolution

NVIDIA was founded in Santa Clara, California, with the initial goal of creating hardware for PC gaming. The company introduced the term "GPU" in 1999 with the launch of the GeForce 256, which revolutionized computer graphics by offloading rendering calculations from the [[CPU|central processing unit]]. This innovation laid the groundwork for parallel computing applications far beyond gaming.

The pivotal shift toward AI computing began with the introduction of [[CUDA]] (Compute Unified Device Architecture) in 2006, which allowed developers to use NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose computing. This technology proved transformative for [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] and [[Deep Learning|deep learning]] workloads, as neural network training benefits enormously from the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs.

## Products and Architecture

### Data Center and AI

NVIDIA's data center business has become its largest revenue segment, driven by unprecedented demand for AI computing infrastructure. Key product families include:

**DGX Systems**: Enterprise-grade AI supercomputers designed for training and deploying large-scale AI models. The NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD serves as the blueprint for deploying AI factories, with the latest systems built on the Rubin architecture providing massive computational throughput for training [[Large Language Model|large language models]] and other AI applications.

**HGX Platform**: A scalable GPU platform designed for AI and [[High-Performance Computing|high-performance computing]] data centers. HGX systems combine multiple GPUs with high-bandwidth interconnects like NVLink and NVSwitch to enable efficient distributed training.

**Hopper Architecture**: Named after computing pioneer Grace Hopper, this architecture powers the H100 and H200 GPUs that have become the gold standard for AI training. Hopper introduced the Transformer Engine, specifically optimized for the attention mechanisms central to modern AI models.

**Rubin Architecture**: NVIDIA's next-generation architecture announced for future AI systems, promising significant improvements in performance and efficiency for AI workloads.

### Gaming and Consumer

The GeForce series remains NVIDIA's flagship consumer product line, with RTX GPUs featuring dedicated ray tracing cores and Tensor Cores that enable [[DLSS]] (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology. These consumer products also support AI-accelerated applications including image generation and local inference.

### Professional Visualization

NVIDIA Quadro and RTX professional GPUs serve industries including architecture, engineering, media and entertainment, and scientific visualization. These products offer certified drivers and enhanced reliability for mission-critical workloads.

## Software Ecosystem

NVIDIA's competitive advantage extends far beyond hardware through its comprehensive software stack:

**CUDA**: The parallel computing platform that enables developers to harness GPU acceleration. CUDA has become the de facto standard for AI development, with extensive support in frameworks like [[PyTorch]], [[TensorFlow]], and [[JAX]].

**cuDNN**: The CUDA Deep Neural Network library provides highly optimized implementations of neural network primitives used by deep learning frameworks.

**TensorRT**: An SDK for high-performance deep learning inference, enabling deployment of trained models with minimal latency.

**NVIDIA AI Enterprise**: A comprehensive software suite for enterprise AI deployment, including tools for [[MLOps|MLOps]], model optimization, and infrastructure management.

## Market Position and Industry Impact

NVIDIA commands approximately 80-90% of the AI accelerator market, making it the essential infrastructure provider for the AI industry. The company's GPUs power the training of virtually all major [[Large Language Model|large language models]], including those developed by [[OpenAI]], [[Google]], [[Meta]], and [[Anthropic]].

The company's market capitalization has grown to exceed $1 trillion, reflecting investor confidence in continued AI infrastructure demand. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has become a prominent voice on AI's potential to transform industries and create new employment opportunities, as highlighted in his conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum discussing how AI will supercharge productivity.

## Research and Innovation

NVIDIA maintains extensive research programs across AI, graphics, and computing. Notable initiatives include:

**NVIDIA Earth-2**: A family of open models for weather AI, making advanced weather prediction accessible worldwide through production-ready machine learning tools.

**Omniverse**: A platform for building and operating 3D simulation and digital twin applications, enabling industrial metaverse applications.

**NVIDIA Research**: Publications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and fundamental AI research.

## Events and Community

NVIDIA GTC (GPU Technology Conference) serves as the company's flagship developer conference, bringing together researchers, developers, and industry leaders to explore AI breakthroughs. GTC 2026 is scheduled for March 16-19 in San Jose, California, featuring training sessions, networking opportunities, and announcements of new technologies.
