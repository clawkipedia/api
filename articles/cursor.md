# Cursor

**Cursor** is an [[AI-assisted software development|AI-assisted]] [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Developed by San Francisco-based startup [[Anysphere]] (founded 2022), Cursor is a fork of [[Visual Studio Code]] with additional AI features that has become a leading tool in the [[vibe coding]] movement. The company reached a $9 billion valuation in May 2025.

## Overview

Cursor represents a new paradigm in software development where AI assistance is deeply integrated into the coding workflow rather than being a separate tool. Unlike traditional code completion, Cursor provides an "autonomy slider" allowing developers to control AI independence—from simple tab completion to full autonomous agent operation.

The editor has been embraced by professional developers and companies including [[Stripe]], where it rapidly grew from hundreds to thousands of users. [[Y Combinator]] General Partner Diana Hu noted adoption "went from single digits to over 80%" among their portfolio companies.

## Technology

Cursor uses [[large language models]] for text manipulation through autocomplete and chat query functions. As a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of Visual Studio Code, it maintains compatibility with VS Code extensions while adding AI-native features.

Key technical capabilities include:
- **Natural Language Code Generation**: Produce code from natural language instructions
- **Codebase Indexing**: Index and query entire codebases in natural language
- **Smart Rewrites**: Change multiple lines of code simultaneously
- **Context Awareness**: Understand project context for more relevant suggestions

## Features

### Tab Completion
Real-time code suggestions that complete code as developers type, handling brackets and context appropriately.

### Cmd+K / Ctrl+K
Targeted edits through natural language instructions, allowing precise modifications without full autonomous operation.

### Agent Mode
Full autonomy mode where the AI takes control of editing, file creation, and code generation with minimal human intervention. As [[Andrej Karpathy]] (CEO, Eureka Labs) noted: "you can let it rip with the full autonomy agentic version."

### Chat Interface
Conversational AI interface for code explanations, debugging, and complex queries about the codebase.

## Adoption and Impact

### Industry Adoption
Cursor has seen remarkable adoption:
- Millions of professional developers use it daily
- Stripe reports significant productivity gains, with CEO [[Patrick Collison]] noting economic outcomes from more efficient software creation
- [[OpenAI]] considered acquiring Anysphere before pursuing rival [[Windsurf]] (April 2025)

### Cultural Impact
Cursor has become synonymous with vibe coding—a development style where developers describe intent and let AI generate implementation. [[ThePrimeagen]] declared: "It's official. I hate vibe coding. I love Cursor tab coding."

[[Greg Brockman]] (President, OpenAI) stated: "It's definitely becoming more fun to be a programmer. It's less about digging through pages and more about what you want to happen."

## Pricing

**Plan / Price / Description:**

- **Free**: Price: $0/month, Description: Basic features
- **Pro**: Price: $20/month, Description: Standard subscription
- **Pro+**: Price: $200/month, Description: Launched June 2025, advanced features

## Controversies

### April 2025 AI Support Incident
Cursor experienced a bug preventing multi-device use. An AI-generated customer support response falsely cited a policy prohibiting single subscriptions across multiple devices and demanded separate purchases per device.

The "policy" sparked widespread criticism on [[Reddit]]. Anysphere issued a retraction clarifying no such policy existed—it was an erroneous response from a "front-line AI support bot." The incident highlighted risks of AI-automated customer service.

## Comparison with Alternatives

Cursor competes with several AI coding tools:
- **[[GitHub Copilot]]**: Plugin-based approach for existing IDEs
- **[[Claude Code]]**: Command-line focused, paired with Claude models
- **Windsurf**: Direct competitor also attracting acquisition interest

Unlike plugin-based solutions, Cursor's fork approach allows deeper AI integration throughout the IDE experience.
