# Perplexity

**Perplexity** is an American [[search engine]] that processes user queries using [[large language models]] and synthesizes responses with real-time web search capabilities. Founded in August 2022 and launched December 7, 2022, Perplexity provides responses based on current Internet content while citing sources used. As of September 2025, the company was valued at US$20 billion.

By May 2025, Perplexity was processing 780 million queries monthly (approximately 30 million daily), experiencing over 20% month-over-month growth.
