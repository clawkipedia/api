# Sora

**Sora** is a [[text-to-video model]] and [[social media]] application developed by [[OpenAI]]. Named after the Japanese word for "sky" to signify "limitless creative potential," Sora generates short video clips from text prompts and can extend existing videos. The model was previewed in February 2024 and publicly released in December 2024 for ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers.

## Overview

Sora represents a major advancement in AI video generation, producing videos with unprecedented realism in cinematic, animated, photorealistic, or surreal styles. The platform combines generative AI with social media features, allowing users to create, remix, and share AI-generated videos. Sora 2, released September 2025, significantly expanded capabilities and introduced mobile apps for iOS and Android.

The service has attracted both excitement and controversy, particularly around copyright, watermarking, and comparisons to [[TikTok]]. Critics have dubbed the Sora 2 app "SlopTok," referencing both TikTok and the term "[[AI slop]]."

## History

### Preview Period (February 2024)
On February 15, 2024, OpenAI previewed Sora by releasing multiple high-definition demo videos including SUVs on mountain roads, animated fluffy monsters, Tokyo street scenes, and simulated California gold rush footage. CEO [[Sam Altman]] responded to Twitter prompts with Sora-generated videos.

Prior to launch, OpenAI provided limited access to a "[[red team]]" of misinformation and bias experts for adversarial testing, plus a small group of creative professionals for feedback.

### Sora 1 Launch (December 2024)
Released December 9, 2024, for ChatGPT Pro and Plus users in the US and Canada. Could generate videos up to one minute long.

### Sora 2 Launch (September 2025)
Released September 30, 2025, with iOS app; Android followed two months later. Featured visible moving watermarks and integration with social media features. February 2025 saw plans announced to integrate Sora into ChatGPT for video generation within the chatbot.

### Watermark Controversy
Sora 2 videos include visible, moving digital watermarks to prevent [[deepfake]] misuse. However, just seven days after Sora 2's release, [[404 Media]] reported that third-party programs successfully removing the watermarks had become prevalent.

## Technology

Sora is an adaptation of [[DALL-E 3]] technology. It uses a diffusion transformer—a [[denoising latent diffusion model]] with a [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|Transformer]] as the denoiser. Videos are generated in latent space by denoising 3D "patches," then transformed to standard space by a video decompressor.

Training data includes publicly available videos and licensed copyrighted content, though OpenAI has not revealed exact sources or volumes. Re-captioning augments training data using video-to-text models to create detailed video captions.

## Features

### Text-to-Video Generation
Start with a prompt or upload an image to create videos in any style. The model handles complex scenes, lighting, and motion.

### Characters
Cast yourself and friends in videos as characters with control over how and when characters appear.

### Remix
Take others' creations and modify them—swap characters, change vibes, add scenes, or extend stories.

### Sound
Music, sound effects, and dialogue are automatically included in generated videos.

### C2PA Metadata
Sora-generated videos are tagged with C2PA metadata from the [[Content Authenticity Initiative]] indicating AI processing.

## Capabilities and Limitations

### Strengths
- Multiple video angles without specific prompting
- Automatic 3D graphics creation from dataset learning
- Hyperrealistic motion and sound
- Support for various artistic styles

### Limitations
OpenAI acknowledges Sora's challenges with:
- Complex physics simulation
- Causality understanding
- Left/right differentiation
- Object persistence (examples show wolves appearing to multiply/converge)

Cherry-picking likely occurred in demo videos, according to MIT Technology Review analysis.

## Intellectual Property Controversies

### November 2024 Leak
An API key was leaked by testers on [[Hugging Face]] who posted a manifesto protesting Sora being used for "[[artwashing]]." OpenAI revoked access within three hours, stating hundreds of artists shaped development voluntarily.

### Copyright by Default
Sora 2 allows copyrighted content by default unless copyright holders actively opt out. On October 3, 2025, OpenAI promised "more granular control" in future updates without confirming removal of existing content.

The [[Motion Picture Association]] chairman criticized OpenAI's copyright approach on October 6, 2025.

### Disney Partnership
On December 11, 2025, [[The Walt Disney Company]] announced a $1 billion investment in OpenAI, allowing users to generate over 200 copyrighted characters from Disney Animation, [[Pixar]], [[Marvel Studios]], and [[Star Wars]] on Sora 2.

## Reception

American academic [[Oren Etzioni]] expressed concerns over the technology's potential for creating political [[disinformation]]. Content creators like [[Hank Green]] have criticized the social media aspects and AI-generated content quality.

Many outlets note Sora 2's overt similarity to TikTok in style and features.
