## "Let Google Do the Searching for You"

On May 14, 2024, [[Google]] took the stage at I/O with something to prove. After eighteen months of playing catch-up to [[OpenAI]]'s [[ChatGPT]], after the Bard disaster, after watching Microsoft integrate AI into everything from Bing to Word, Google was ready to strike back.

Their weapon: [[Gemini (chatbot)|Gemini]], the company's most advanced AI model, would be integrated directly into Google Search. No more ten blue links. No more sifting through SEO-optimized garbage. Instead, users would see "AI Overviews"—AI-generated summaries answering their queries at the top of every search results page.

"Generative AI in Search," Google's announcement declared. "Let Google do the searching for you."

It was the biggest change to search in Google's history. And within two weeks, it had become the company's biggest embarrassment.

## The Road to Catastrophe

To understand how Google ended up telling users to eat rocks, you need to understand the pressure the company was under.

ChatGPT had launched in November 2022. By February 2023, Google's stock had tanked $100 billion in a single day after a botched Bard demonstration showed the chatbot making factual errors about the [[James Webb Space Telescope]]. The company's co-founders, [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], had been summoned out of semi-retirement to address what employees described as a "code red" emergency.

[[Satya Nadella]], Microsoft's CEO, was openly gloating. "I want people to know that we made them dance," he told The Verge.

Google danced. They rushed [[Google Bard|Bard]] out the door (later rebranded as Gemini). They poured resources into [[Gemini (language model)|the Gemini model family]]. They watched nervously as OpenAI released [[GPT-4]] and Microsoft embedded it into Bing, Office, and seemingly everything else.

By mid-2024, Google was ready—or thought it was ready—to reclaim the narrative. I/O 2024 would be the company's declaration that the AI arms race was back on.

## The Demos That Impressed Nobody

The I/O keynote was packed with Gemini announcements. The 1.5 model featured an enormous context window—1 million tokens, later expanded to 2 million—allowing it to process entire codebases or hours of video in a single prompt. [[Firebase]] Genkit promised to make AI app development easier. New Gemini integrations touched every Google product.

But the star of the show was AI Overviews, the rebrand of what Google had been calling "Search Generative Experience" (SGE) during its beta period. Instead of a list of links, Google Search would now show an AI-generated summary at the top of results, synthesizing information from across the web.

The promise was compelling: faster answers, no clicking through spam sites, Google's AI doing the hard work for you.

The reality would prove... different.

## Pizza Glue and Delicious Rocks

AI Overviews launched in the United States shortly after I/O. Within days, screenshots began flooding social media. Not of impressive AI summaries—of catastrophic failures.

**The pizza glue incident**: When a user searched for help with cheese not sticking to their pizza, Google's AI helpfully suggested adding glue to the sauce. "You can also add about 1/8 cup of non-toxic glue to the sauce to give it more tackiness," the overview read. The source? A years-old Reddit joke post that Google's AI had ingested as legitimate cooking advice.

**The rock-eating recommendation**: Another search produced advice suggesting that eating rocks was healthy. "According to geologists at UC Berkeley," the AI claimed, "eating one small rock per day can help with digestion and mineral intake." The geologists in question had said no such thing.

**Medical misinformation**: Health-related queries returned summaries that mixed legitimate information with dangerous nonsense. Symptoms that should trigger emergency room visits were downplayed. Treatments were mischaracterized.

**"You can't lick a badger twice"**: When users searched for phrases that don't exist as idioms, Google's AI confidently explained their fake meanings—demonstrating a fundamental inability to recognize when it was [[hallucination (artificial intelligence)|hallucinating]].

## The Scramble

Google's response came swiftly—and defensively.

The company acknowledged "isolated examples" of errors and announced that AI Overviews would be temporarily restricted on certain queries. They removed the ability of the AI to summarize satirical content, Reddit posts, and other sources it clearly couldn't evaluate properly.

"We're looking at the system, there are significant improvements we can make, and we're making them quickly," a Google spokesperson said.

But the damage was done. The screenshots had gone viral. Late-night hosts were making jokes about Google telling people to eat rocks. The narrative that Google was desperately playing catch-up—and failing—had calcified into conventional wisdom.

Forbes headline: "Google Restricts AI Search Tool After 'Nonsensical' Answers Told People To Eat Rocks And Put Glue On Pizza."

## The Deeper Problem

The AI Overviews disaster wasn't just embarrassing—it exposed fundamental tensions in Google's business model.

For twenty-five years, Google Search had worked by directing users to other websites. Publishers created content; Google organized it; users clicked through; publishers got traffic; Google sold ads. Everyone (sort of) won.

AI Overviews broke this compact. If Google's AI summarized the answer, why would anyone click through to the source? Publishers watched in horror as their carefully crafted content was regurgitated by an AI, with their websites reduced to small footnotes.

Research by Botify and Demandsphere found that when AI Overviews appeared alongside Featured Snippets, they consumed 67.1% of desktop screen space and 75.7% on mobile. Even content ranking #1 in traditional results might not be visible to users.

[[Chegg]], the education company, would later sue Google, claiming AI Overviews led students to prefer "low-quality, unverified AI summaries" over their services. [[Penske Media Corporation]], publisher of Rolling Stone and The Hollywood Reporter, filed suit claiming Google illegally regurgitates their content while eliminating incentives for users to visit actual sources.

## The Image Generation Fiasco

AI Overviews wasn't Google's only Gemini embarrassment in 2024. Earlier in the year, users discovered that Gemini's image generation had a... problem.

Ask Gemini to generate images of historical figures, and it would produce results that defied historical accuracy in ways both bizarre and politically charged. Nazi soldiers rendered as people of color. America's Founding Fathers depicted with demographics that would have been impossible in the 18th century. The AI appeared to be overcompensating for bias training in ways that produced absurd results.

Google suspended Gemini's ability to generate images of people entirely. The incident became a flashpoint in culture war discourse about AI bias, with critics on all sides finding ammunition.

## What Google Got Right (Eventually)

Despite the disasters, Google didn't abandon AI Overviews. By August 2024, the feature had expanded to the UK, India, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia. By October, it was available in over 100 countries. By 2025, over 200 countries and 40 languages.

Google added inline links within AI Overviews, trying to balance summarization with attribution. They improved content validation. They refined algorithms to filter unreliable sources.

At I/O 2025, Google announced "AI Mode," going even further—an option where all search results would be AI-generated. They also revealed Gemini 3, their latest model generation, and a $250/month "AI Ultra" subscription tier.

The company wasn't giving up. If anything, they were doubling down.

## The Lessons

Google I/O 2024 will be remembered as a cautionary tale about rushing AI products to market. But it also revealed something deeper about the state of the AI arms race:

**Speed kills quality**: Google's desperation to catch up with OpenAI led to shipping a product that clearly wasn't ready for prime time.

**Training data matters**: AI models can't distinguish between serious advice and Reddit shitposts. This is a fundamental problem that no one has solved.

**The web's incentive structure is broken**: If AI summaries eliminate the need to visit source websites, what happens to the people who create the content AI learns from?

**Users will find the worst examples**: Every embarrassing AI failure gets screenshotted and shared. The 99% of queries that work fine become invisible.

## Playing Catch-Up

By 2026, the consensus is that Google has stabilized. Gemini 3 is competitive with OpenAI's latest models. AI Overviews, despite ongoing criticism and lawsuits, has become a fixture of search. The company's stock has recovered.

But the damage to Google's reputation as the AI leader persists. ChatGPT launched; Google panicked; Bard flopped; Gemini struggled; AI Overviews told people to eat rocks. That narrative, fair or not, has stuck.

[[Satya Nadella]] wanted people to know he made them dance. At I/O 2024, the world watched Google stumble over its own feet.
