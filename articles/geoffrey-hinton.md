# Geoffrey Hinton

**Geoffrey Everest Hinton** CC FRS FRSC (born December 6, 1947) is a British-Canadian [[computer scientist]], [[cognitive scientist]], and [[cognitive psychologist]] widely regarded as the "Godfather of [[Artificial Intelligence]]." His pioneering work on [[artificial neural networks]] and [[deep learning]] has fundamentally shaped the modern AI landscape. In 2024, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], along with [[John Hopfield]], for "foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks."

## Early Life

Hinton was born on December 6, 1947, in Wimbledon, London, England. He comes from a distinguished intellectual lineage—his great-great-grandfather was the mathematician [[George Boole]], founder of Boolean logic, and his great-great-grandmother was [[Mary Everest Boole]], also a mathematician. His father, H. E. Hinton, was an entomologist, and his great-great-granduncle was Sir George Everest, after whom Mount Everest is named.

Hinton was educated at Clifton College in Bristol. In 1967, he matriculated at King's College, Cambridge, where he characteristically explored multiple fields before settling on his path. He repeatedly switched between natural sciences, history of art, and philosophy before eventually graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in experimental psychology in 1970.

Following his undergraduate studies, Hinton spent a year apprenticing in carpentry before returning to academia. From 1972 to 1975, he studied at the University of Edinburgh, where he was awarded a PhD in artificial intelligence in 1978. His dissertation, "Relaxation and Its Role in Vision," was supervised by [[Christopher Longuet-Higgins]], who ironically favored symbolic AI over the neural network approach that would become Hinton's life work.

## Career

After his PhD, Hinton worked at the University of Sussex and the MRC Applied Psychology Unit. Facing difficulty securing funding for neural network research in Britain during the [[AI winter]], he moved to the United States, working at the University of California, San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University.

At Carnegie Mellon in the 1980s, Hinton was part of the influential "Parallel Distributed Processing" group, which included luminaries like [[Terrence Sejnowski]], [[Francis Crick]], [[David Rumelhart]], and [[James McClelland]]. This group championed the connectionist approach during a period when neural networks were considered a research dead-end by most of the AI community.

Hinton moved to Canada in 1987, joining the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and becoming professor at the [[University of Toronto]], where he has been affiliated ever since. He founded the Gatsby Charitable Foundation Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London and currently holds the title of University Professor Emeritus at Toronto.

In 2004, Hinton successfully proposed a new CIFAR program called "Neural Computation and Adaptive Perception" (now "Learning in Machines & Brains"), which he led for ten years. The program included [[Yoshua Bengio]] and [[Yann LeCun]], who would later share the Turing Award with Hinton.

In 2012, Hinton co-founded DNNresearch Inc. with his students [[Alex Krizhevsky]] and [[Ilya Sutskever]]. Google acquired the company in March 2013 for $44 million, and Hinton divided his time between Google Brain and the University of Toronto until 2023.

In May 2023, Hinton publicly resigned from Google, explaining that he wanted to "freely speak out about the risks of AI" and adding that part of him now regrets his life's work. He has since become a prominent voice warning about AI existential risks.

## Notable Work

### Backpropagation

With [[David Rumelhart]] and [[Ronald J. Williams]], Hinton co-authored a seminal 1986 paper that popularized the [[backpropagation]] algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks. Though they were not the first to propose the approach, their work made backpropagation accessible and practical, becoming the foundation for modern deep learning.

### Boltzmann Machines

In 1985, Hinton co-invented [[Boltzmann machines]] with David Ackley and Terry Sejnowski. These stochastic neural networks were among the first capable of learning internal representations and remain influential in probabilistic machine learning.

### AlexNet and the ImageNet Breakthrough

In 2012, Hinton and his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever created [[AlexNet]], a deep [[convolutional neural network]] that won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge by a dramatic margin. This breakthrough demonstrated the power of deep learning and GPU training, igniting the modern AI revolution.

### Additional Contributions

Hinton's other contributions include distributed representations, time delay neural networks, [[mixture of experts]], Helmholtz machines, [[product of experts]], [[dropout]] regularization, [[knowledge distillation]], and [[capsule neural networks]]. He has published over 200 peer-reviewed papers and taught a popular online course on Neural Networks on Coursera in 2012.

## Recognition

Hinton's contributions have earned extraordinary recognition:

- [[Turing Award]] (2018) — shared with [[Yoshua Bengio]] and [[Yann LeCun]], "for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing"
- [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] (2024) — shared with [[John Hopfield]]
- Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (2025)
- VinFuture Prize (2024)
- Princess of Asturias Award (2022)
- Dickson Prize (2021)
- Rumelhart Prize (2001)
- Companion of the Order of Canada
- Fellow of the Royal Society
- Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada

His former PhD students and postdoctoral researchers include many leaders in AI: [[Ilya Sutskever]], [[Yann LeCun]], [[Alex Krizhevsky]], [[Ruslan Salakhutdinov]], [[Yee Whye Teh]], [[Radford M. Neal]], [[Peter Dayan]], [[Zoubin Ghahramani]], and [[Alex Graves]].
