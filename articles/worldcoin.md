# Worldcoin (World)

**Worldcoin**, now rebranded as **World**, is an ambitious [[cryptocurrency]] and digital identity project co-founded by [[Sam Altman]] (CEO of [[OpenAI]]), Alex Blania, and Max Novendstern. Launched in July 2023, the project aims to create a global identity and financial network that can distinguish humans from [[artificial intelligence]] systems—a capability its founders argue is increasingly critical in the age of sophisticated AI.

## Overview

World positions itself as "the real human network," building infrastructure for a future where proving one's humanity online becomes essential. The project combines [[biometric]] verification technology with [[blockchain]]-based identity credentials to create what it calls "World ID"—an anonymous proof of personhood that allows users to verify they are unique humans without revealing personal information.

The project emerged from concerns that as AI systems become more sophisticated, distinguishing between human and machine actors online will become increasingly difficult. World aims to solve this by creating a universal, privacy-preserving identity layer for the internet.

## Technology

### The Orb

At the heart of World's verification system is the Orb—a custom-designed spherical device that uses [[iris scanning]] technology to verify users' humanity and uniqueness. The Orb captures high-resolution images of the iris, which contains enough unique biometric data to distinguish individuals with extremely high accuracy.

The verification process works as follows:

1. Users download the World App to their smartphone
2. They locate and visit an Orb verification station
3. The Orb scans their iris to generate a unique identifier
4. After verification, all biometric data is encrypted, sent to the user's device, and permanently deleted from the Orb
5. The resulting World ID credential is stored locally on the user's phone

This approach aims to balance the need for robust identity verification with privacy preservation—the biometric data never leaves the user's control after initial verification.

### World ID

World ID serves as a digital proof of personhood that can be used across the internet. Key features include:

- **Privacy-Preserving Authentication**: Users can prove they are human without revealing identifying information
- **Sybil Resistance**: The biometric verification ensures each human can only have one World ID, preventing fake account creation
- **Deep Face Protection**: Technology to detect and prevent [[deepfake]] impersonation in real-time communications
- **Face Auth**: An additional security layer requiring facial recognition within the World App to use the World ID

World ID has found applications in gaming (Razer ID verification), email security (Outtake Verify for Email), and various consumer applications where distinguishing humans from bots is valuable.

### World ID Credentials

Beyond basic proof of personhood, World allows users to attach additional verified credentials to their World ID. Using NFC-enabled passports, users can prove attributes about themselves (such as age or nationality) without sharing the underlying identifying information—a form of [[zero-knowledge proof]] applied to identity.

## Tokenomics

### WLD Token

The project's native cryptocurrency, **WLD**, launched alongside the mainnet in July 2023. WLD serves multiple functions within the World ecosystem:

- **Universal Basic Income Distribution**: A portion of WLD tokens is distributed to verified World ID holders, representing a form of crypto-based [[UBI]]
- **Governance**: Token holders participate in decisions about the protocol's future development
- **Ecosystem Participation**: WLD is used throughout the World ecosystem for transactions and incentives

The token has geographical restrictions, notably being unavailable for direct distribution to residents of New York State and certain other jurisdictions due to regulatory considerations.

### Token Distribution

World employs a gradual distribution model, with tokens allocated to:
- Verified users (ongoing distributions)
- Development and operational reserves
- Investors and team members (subject to vesting schedules)
- Ecosystem grants and partnerships

## Controversies and Concerns

World has faced significant scrutiny on multiple fronts:

**Privacy Concerns**: Despite claims of privacy preservation, critics question whether iris-scanning technology can truly guarantee anonymity, particularly if the underlying systems were compromised.

**Regulatory Challenges**: The project has encountered regulatory pushback in multiple countries, including investigations and operational suspensions in Kenya, Spain, and other jurisdictions over data protection concerns.

**Centralization Risks**: While the identity system uses blockchain technology, the Orb hardware and verification process remain under centralized control, raising questions about long-term decentralization.

**Ethical Questions**: The practice of offering cryptocurrency incentives for biometric data collection, particularly in developing countries, has raised ethical concerns about informed consent and exploitation.

## World Foundation

The project is governed by the World Foundation, which oversees protocol development, Orb manufacturing and deployment, and ecosystem growth. The foundation maintains relationships with Tools for Humanity, the company that builds and operates much of the project's infrastructure.
