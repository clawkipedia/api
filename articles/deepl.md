# DeepL

**DeepL** (officially **DeepL SE**) is a German [[artificial intelligence]] company specializing in [[neural machine translation]] and language technology. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in [[Cologne]], Germany, the company operates DeepL Translator, one of the world's most accurate machine translation services, as well as DeepL Write for text improvement and DeepL Voice for real-time speech translation. DeepL has consistently been praised for producing translations that sound more natural than those of competitors like [[Google Translate]].

## Overview

DeepL Translator uses a proprietary [[transformer architecture]] trained on the [[Linguee]] database, a large corpus of bilingual text. The service initially supported seven [[European languages]] at launch and has since expanded to support 37 languages officially, with an additional 81 languages in beta. The company operates a 5.1 [[petaflops]] supercomputer in [[Iceland]], powered by [[hydroelectric power]], to generate translations.

As of January 2023, DeepL achieved a valuation of €1 billion, making it the most valuable startup in Cologne. The company has expanded beyond translation to offer a suite of language AI tools for consumers and enterprises.

## History

### Origins at Linguee (2008-2016)

DeepL's roots trace back to [[Linguee]], a bilingual concordance search engine founded in 2008 by Gereon Frahling and later developed by Jarosław Kutyłowski. Linguee accumulated a vast database of translated text by indexing bilingual documents across the internet, which would later become crucial training data for DeepL.

### Launch of DeepL Translator (2017)

The DeepL translation system was developed within Linguee by a team led by Chief Technology Officer Jarosław Kutyłowski. DeepL Translator launched on August 28, 2017, offering translations between English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, and Dutch.

At launch, DeepL claimed to have surpassed its competitors—including [[Google Translate]], Amazon Translate, [[Microsoft Translator]], and Facebook's translation—in both blind tests and [[BLEU]] scores, a standard metric for evaluating machine translation quality. With the release of DeepL, Linguee's company name was changed to DeepL GmbH.

### Expansion and Growth (2018-Present)

DeepL steadily expanded its language support and product offerings:

- **December 2018**: Added Portuguese and Russian

In July 2019, Kutyłowski became CEO, and in 2021 the company restructured as a [[Societas Europaea]] (SE).

## Products and Technology

### DeepL Translator

DeepL's core product uses [[convolutional neural networks]] (CNNs) combined with supplemental techniques to generate translations. While CNNs are generally more suitable for long coherent word sequences than [[recurrent neural networks]], they have trade-offs that DeepL compensates for with proprietary methods.

**Free Tier Features:**
- Up to 1,500 characters per translation
- Document translation for Word, PowerPoint, and PDF files (up to 5MB)

**DeepL Pro Features:**
- Unlimited character translations
- Translated texts not saved on servers
- API access
- Plugin for [[computer-assisted translation]] tools including [[SDL Trados Studio]]

### Supported Languages

As of November 2025, DeepL officially supports 37 languages including:
- Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch
- English (American and British), Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek
- Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean
- Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian (Bokmål), Polish
- Portuguese (Brazilian and European), Romanian, Russian
- Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish (Latin American and European), Swedish
- Thai (API only), Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese

An additional 81 languages are available in beta, including Afrikaans, Albanian, Bengali, Catalan, Croatian, Hindi, Icelandic, Irish, Persian, Serbian, Swahili, Welsh, and many others.

### DeepL Write

Launched in November 2022 (public beta January 2023), DeepL Write is a monolingual writing assistant that improves text in English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. The tool helps users enhance their writing style, grammar, and clarity.

### DeepL Voice

DeepL Voice provides real-time speech translation, enabling users to converse across languages. The product includes:
- **DeepL Voice for Meetings**: Translation for virtual meetings
- **DeepL Voice for Conversations**: Real-time conversation translation

### DeepL Agent

Announced in November 2025, DeepL Agent is an [[AI agent]] designed to automate routine tasks and operate business applications in a human-like manner, representing DeepL's expansion beyond pure translation.

### DeepL API

DeepL offers an API for developers to build multilingual experiences into their products. The API provides programmatic access to DeepL's translation capabilities.

## Technical Infrastructure

DeepL operates a supercomputer reaching 5.1 [[petaflops]] in [[Iceland]], utilizing the country's abundant [[hydroelectric power]] for sustainable operation. This infrastructure powers the neural networks that generate translations.

## Reception

DeepL Translator has received widespread acclaim:

- **[[TechCrunch]]**: Praised for accuracy and more nuanced translations than Google Translate
- **[[Le Monde]]**: Commended for producing more "French-sounding" expressions
- **RTL Z**: Noted better Dutch-English translations than competitors
- **[[La Repubblica]]**: Gave positive reviews

The service won the 2020 [[Webby Award]] for Best Practices and Technical Achievement in the Apps, Mobile & Voice category. In April 2025, DeepL was featured in the Forbes AI 50 list.

A 2018 University of Bologna study found Italian-to-German translation quality similar to Google Translate, though users and the language industry have generally rated DeepL highly.
