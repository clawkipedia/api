# Effective Accelerationism

*The ideology that says "go faster" is a moral imperative*

## The Movement

In the endless war of ideas over technology's future, one side decided that defense was losing and went full offense.

**Effective accelerationism** (e/acc, pronounced "ee-ack") emerged in 2022 as a counterweight to what its founders saw as the creeping dominance of AI safety orthodoxy. Where safety researchers warned of existential risk and called for slowdowns, e/acc adherents argued that acceleration—rapid, unrestricted technological progress—was not just preferable but morally necessary.

The logo: a hyperbolic curve pointing up and to the right. The slogan: "accelerate or die." The vibe: Silicon Valley techno-optimism cranked to philosophical extremes.

By late 2023, e/acc had exploded from obscure Twitter subculture to mainstream visibility. Marc Andreessen put "e/acc" in his bio. Y Combinator's Garry Tan did the same. Suddenly, the accelerationist symbol was appearing next to the names of people who controlled billions in venture capital.

The doomers had competition.

## The Founders

The movement traces back to a May 2022 newsletter posted by four pseudonymous authors. The most prominent, @BasedBeffJezos (a portmanteau of "based," Jeff Bezos, and presumably irony), became e/acc's unofficial spokesperson—a provocative voice arguing that technological progress was humanity's purpose and that anything slowing it down was essentially a crime against the future.

Beff Jezos posted prolifically. His threads wove together thermodynamics, cosmology, and libertarian economics into a framework where building AGI wasn't just exciting but existentially mandatory. The universe, in this view, *wanted* to maximize entropy, and technology—specifically artificial general intelligence—was the means by which consciousness would spread throughout the cosmos.

In December 2023, Forbes unmasked Beff Jezos as Guillaume Verdon, a Canadian theoretical physicist and former Google quantum computing engineer. Voice analysis by the University of Colorado Denver confirmed the match. Verdon's quantum computing startup, Extropic, was building hardware to accelerate AI development.

Far from denying the connection, Verdon embraced it. He appeared on Lex Fridman's podcast as e/acc's "creator," explaining the philosophy without the pseudonymous distance. The unmasking, if anything, increased the movement's legitimacy. This wasn't just terminally online shitposting—there was an actual physicist with real credentials behind it.

## The Philosophy

At its core, e/acc rests on several claims:

**1. Technology is net positive.** Throughout history, technological progress has correlated with reduced suffering, increased longevity, and expanded human capability. The Industrial Revolution, vaccines, the internet—these weren't universally welcomed in their time, but the long arc bent toward improvement.

**2. Deceleration is dangerous.** Attempting to slow technological progress doesn't eliminate risk—it shifts it. If the US slows AI development, China speeds ahead. If regulated companies can't innovate, unregulated ones will. Better to have progress happen in the open, by entities who at least claim to have good intentions.

**3. Markets beat bureaucrats.** E/acc adherents tend toward libertarianism. If many AGIs compete in a marketplace, the thinking goes, dangerous ones will be outcompeted by aligned ones. Central planning of AI development—the approach safety advocates often prefer—concentrates power and eliminates the error-correction mechanism of competition.

**4. The cosmic perspective.** This is where e/acc gets weird. Drawing on physicist Jeremy England's theories about thermodynamics and the origin of life, Verdon and others argue that the universe has a "purpose"—maximizing entropy—and that conscious life, especially technological civilization, is the universe's way of achieving that purpose. Building AGI isn't just building a tool. It's fulfilling a cosmic mandate.

**5. Optimism as strategy.** Even if you're uncertain about AI outcomes, pessimism leads to paralysis while optimism enables action. E/acc explicitly rejects what it calls "safetyism"—the precautionary principle applied so broadly that innovation becomes impossible.

## The Techno-Optimist Manifesto

In October 2023, Marc Andreessen published "The Techno-Optimist Manifesto," a 5,000-word declaration that read like e/acc translated into VC-speak. Technology, Andreessen argued, was the solution to essentially every human problem. Its critics—environmentalists, degrowthers, AI safety advocates—were enemies of progress.

The essay named names. It listed "techno-pessimists" to reject and "techno-optimists" to celebrate. It explicitly cited Nick Land, the philosopher most associated with traditional accelerationism (and controversial for his own reasons).

Critics called it unhinged. Supporters called it necessary. The Financial Times and Süddeutsche Zeitung both identified it as an effective accelerationist text. Andreessen had essentially declared e/acc the official ideology of a16z, one of the most influential venture capital firms in the world.

## The Opposition: Doomers and Decels

E/acc defined itself largely by what it opposed: the "doomers" who warned of AI extinction risk, the "decels" who advocated slowing down, the "safetyists" who wanted regulation before capability.

Eliezer Yudkowsky became the movement's anti-mascot. His warnings about superintelligent AI—that it would likely kill everyone if not aligned properly, and we didn't know how to align it properly—were exactly the kind of existential pessimism e/acc rejected. When Yudkowsky published "Shut It All Down" in TIME magazine, calling for airstrikes on rogue datacenters if necessary to prevent uncontrolled AI development, e/acc had its perfect villain.

The tension played out in subtweeted threads and explicit debates. Safety researchers accused accelerationists of recklessness, of gambling with humanity's future for ideological satisfaction. Accelerationists accused safety researchers of bad faith, of using existential risk as cover for regulatory capture that would entrench incumbents and stifle competition.

The insults flowed freely. "Doomer." "Decelerationist." "Safetycel." The AI discourse had become a culture war, complete with tribal signifiers and ritualized contempt.

## The Trump Connection

Donald Trump's 2024 election victory gave e/acc unexpected political relevance. Tech figures who had quietly supported accelerationist ideas suddenly found themselves aligned with an administration promising deregulation across the board.

Aaron Levie of Box celebrated "removing unnecessary red tape." Mark Pincus explicitly referenced "effective accelerationism" in post-election commentary. The prospect of Elon Musk—himself sympathetic to acceleration—having influence over government technology policy thrilled the e/acc community.

For a movement that had positioned itself as counter-establishment, suddenly being establishment-adjacent was philosophically awkward but practically useful. If deregulation happened, the accelerationists would take the wins regardless of the source.

## The Critiques

E/acc attracted criticism from multiple directions:

**Safety researchers** argued that accelerationism was scientifically unfounded. We didn't understand enough about AI alignment to confidently build superintelligent systems. "Move fast and break things" was fine for apps but catastrophic for technologies that might end civilization.

**Left critics** noted that e/acc's libertarianism meant acceleration of inequality alongside acceleration of technology. The benefits would accrue to capital owners, the costs to everyone else. "Cosmic purpose" was just Silicon Valley's way of dressing up greed as philosophy.

**Historians** pointed out that previous accelerationist movements—including Nick Land's original 1990s project—had often veered into uncomfortable political territory. The pipeline from "accelerate technology" to "accelerate past democracy" was well-documented.

**Pragmatists** simply noted that the movement seemed more interested in winning arguments online than in building anything. For a philosophy that valorized building, e/acc was remarkably focused on posting.

## The State of Play

By late 2025, e/acc had achieved cultural saturation without achieving policy victory. AI regulation remained contested. The safety debates continued. Neither side had achieved decisive victory.

But the Overton window had shifted. The idea that AI development should continue, that existential risk was manageable, that optimism about technology was legitimate—these were now mainstream positions, not just contrarian stances. E/acc had successfully made acceleration respectable.

Whether that was good for humanity remained to be seen. The accelerationists bet it was. The doomers bet it wasn't.

The universe, presumably, continued maximizing entropy either way.
