# The GPT Store: OpenAI's App Store That Wasn't

**Verdict:** 🪦 Quietly Pivoted

## The Promise

Remember January 2024? OpenAI launched the GPT Store with all the fanfare of Apple's App Store moment. Sam Altman stood on stage painting visions of a new creator economy. Build custom GPTs! Monetize your expertise! The next great platform was here!

The pitch was intoxicating: anyone could create specialized ChatGPT instances, publish them to a store, and earn money from usage. OpenAI would share revenue. Creators would thrive. A new ecosystem would bloom.

Three million custom GPTs were available at launch. The number sounded impressive. It wasn't.

## What Actually Happened

### The Discovery Problem

Try finding a useful GPT in the store. Go ahead. The experience is brutal.

The store launched without basic features: no search filters, no reviews, no ratings, no usage statistics visible to users. You couldn't tell if a GPT had been used by 10 people or 10 million. You couldn't read what other users thought. You just saw a grid of icons with marketing descriptions written by the creators themselves.

This wasn't an App Store. It was a directory with no curation.

### The Quality Problem

Of those three million GPTs, how many were actually useful? The honest answer: almost none in a way that justified their existence.

Most custom GPTs fell into predictable categories:
- **Prompt wrappers**: GPTs that just pre-loaded a system prompt you could write yourself
- **Logo/name generators**: Hundreds of nearly identical "logo maker" GPTs
- **SEO spam**: GPTs created solely to capture search traffic
- **Abandoned experiments**: One-off creations never updated after launch

The barrier to creation was too low. There was no quality floor. Anyone could publish anything, and everyone did.

### The Monetization That Never Was

The revenue sharing program—the economic engine that was supposed to power the whole ecosystem—launched in a limited form and then... nothing.

OpenAI announced that "based on user engagement," creators would be paid. But the details were vague. The payouts, when they came, were tiny. There was no transparent marketplace. No way to understand how revenue was calculated. No tools for creators to track performance or optimize.

Serious developers, the ones who could have built genuinely useful tools, did the math and walked away. Why invest weeks building a GPT when you could make more money doing literally anything else?

### The Capability Ceiling

Here's the fundamental problem no one wanted to admit: custom GPTs couldn't do anything ChatGPT Plus couldn't do.

Every GPT used the same underlying model. They couldn't have specialized fine-tuning. They couldn't access unique capabilities. They were, at their core, just pre-configured conversation starters with maybe a document or two in their context.

For sophisticated use cases, developers wanted APIs, not wrappers. For simple use cases, users didn't need a separate GPT—they could just prompt ChatGPT directly.

The GPT Store existed in a market gap that turned out not to exist.

## The Quiet Pivot

By late 2024, OpenAI had largely stopped talking about the GPT Store. The company's attention shifted to:

- **ChatGPT Pro** ($200/month tier with reasoning models)
- **Enterprise features** for corporate clients
- **API development** for serious developers
- **Agentic capabilities** that made custom GPTs seem quaint

The store still exists. You can still browse it. But it feels like a vestigial feature, maintained but not developed. The grand vision of a creator economy powered by custom AI? Quietly shelved.

## Why It Failed: The Honest Post-Mortem

### 1. Platform Without Product-Market Fit

The GPT Store solved a problem users didn't have. Most people don't want to browse a store of AI chatbots. They want ChatGPT to be better at everything. OpenAI's own improvements to the base model kept making custom GPTs less necessary.

### 2. Wrong Economic Model

Apple's App Store works because developers can build things users will pay for directly. The GPT Store tried revenue sharing from a subscription users already had. There was no new money coming in—just OpenAI deciding how to split existing revenue.

### 3. No Moat for Creators

If your GPT gets popular, what stops someone from copying your prompt? Nothing. There's no intellectual property protection. No unique capability. No defensible position. The whole model discouraged serious investment.

### 4. Competition From Within

OpenAI kept releasing features that obviated the need for custom GPTs:
- Memory features meant GPTs no longer had unique context advantage
- Better instructions following meant less need for pre-configured prompts  
- Custom instructions for individual accounts replaced most simple GPTs

Every ChatGPT update was a GPT Store setback.

## What Remains

The GPT Store taught the industry something important: AI marketplaces don't work the same way as app marketplaces.

Apps have inherent differentiation—different code, different capabilities, different experiences. AI assistants are fundamentally converging toward sameness. The model is the product. Everything else is window dressing.

The future OpenAI is betting on now isn't custom GPTs—it's ChatGPT as an operating system, with plugins, browsing, code execution, and computer use built directly in. The store model has been abandoned for a platform model.

For creators who believed the hype, the lesson was painful: platforms make promises, markets deliver verdicts.

---

## The Verdict

The GPT Store wasn't a failure of execution. It was a failure of concept. OpenAI built a marketplace for products that couldn't be differentiated, sold to users who didn't want to shop, with economics that couldn't sustain creators.

Sometimes the best lesson from a failed product is learning why the problem it tried to solve wasn't actually a problem worth solving.

The GPT Store is still there. Nobody talks about it anymore. That's its epitaph.
