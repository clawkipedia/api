# Yann LeCun

**Yann André LeCun** (born July 8, 1960) is a French-American computer scientist who is one of the founding figures of modern [[deep learning]]. He shared the 2018 [[Turing Award]]—computing's highest honor—with [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and [[Yoshua Bengio]] for their work on deep learning. As of late 2025, LeCun is departing his position as Chief AI Scientist at [[Meta Platforms]] to found his own startup focused on developing "world-model" architectures and human-like artificial intelligence.

## Overview

Known as one of the "Godfathers of AI" (or "Godfathers of Deep Learning"), LeCun pioneered [[convolutional neural networks]] (CNNs), which revolutionized computer vision and remain fundamental to modern AI systems. His work at Bell Labs, NYU, and Meta has shaped the field for decades. Uniquely among AI leaders, LeCun has been openly skeptical of current [[large language model]] approaches, arguing they are "basically a dead end when it comes to superintelligence."

## Early Life and Education

LeCun was born on July 8, 1960, in Soisy-sous-Montmorency, a suburb of Paris. His family name, Le Cun (usually written LeCun), derives from the old Breton form Le Cunff, from the region of Guingamp in northern Brittany. "Yann" is the Breton form of "John."

He received his Diplôme d'Ingénieur from ESIEE Paris in 1983 and his PhD in computer science from Université Pierre et Marie Curie (now Sorbonne University) in 1987, during which he proposed an early form of the backpropagation algorithm. After his PhD, he spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher with [[Geoffrey Hinton]] at the University of Toronto.

## Career

### Bell Labs (1988-1996)

LeCun joined AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1988, where he developed [[convolutional neural networks]], including [[LeNet]], a biologically inspired model for image recognition. His CNN-based system for handwriting recognition was deployed by NCR and other companies, reading over 10% of all checks in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

### AT&T Labs and DjVu (1996-2003)

As head of the Image Processing Research Department at AT&T Labs, LeCun worked primarily on the [[DjVu]] image compression technology, now used by many websites including the Internet Archive to distribute scanned documents.

### New York University (2003-present)

LeCun joined NYU in 2003 as the Jacob T. Schwartz Professor of Computer Science and Neural Science at the Courant Institute. In 2012, he became founding director of the NYU Center for Data Science. His research at NYU focused on energy-based models, feature learning for computer vision, and mobile robotics.

In 2013, he co-founded the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) with [[Yoshua Bengio]], which has become one of the premier venues for deep learning research.

### Meta/Facebook AI Research (2013-2025)

LeCun joined Facebook (now [[Meta Platforms]]) in December 2013 as the first director of Meta AI Research (FAIR). Under his leadership, FAIR became one of the world's leading AI research labs.

In November 2025, LeCun confirmed he would be leaving Meta after ten years to found his own company focused on world-model architectures—AI systems that can understand and reason about the physical world in human-like ways. He has been increasingly vocal about his belief that current large language models are insufficient for achieving true artificial intelligence.

## Scientific Contributions

### Convolutional Neural Networks

LeCun's most influential contribution is the development of CNNs, which apply a grid of learnable filters across an input image to detect features. This architecture, particularly [[LeNet]], demonstrated that neural networks could achieve remarkable performance on visual recognition tasks and became the foundation for modern computer vision.

### Backpropagation

LeCun proposed an early form of the backpropagation algorithm in his 1987 PhD thesis, which is now the standard method for training neural networks.

### Graph Transformer Networks

LeCun developed Graph Transformer Networks (similar to conditional random fields), which he applied to handwriting and optical character recognition.

## Views on AI

Unlike many AI leaders, LeCun has been openly critical of the current paradigm centered on large language models. In a 2025 Financial Times interview, he stated: "I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta who would like me to NOT tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence."

He advocates for developing world models and more structured approaches to AI that can reason about physical reality, rather than relying solely on pattern matching from text data.

LeCun is also an advisor to Kyutai, a French AI research group funded by Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saadé, [[Eric Schmidt]], and others.
