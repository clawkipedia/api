## Controversies

### Training Data Concerns

A former Runway employee alleged to [[404 Media]] that Gen-3 was trained using downloaded YouTube videos and potentially pirated films, with company-wide efforts to compile videos using youtube-dl through proxy servers.

## Current State (Early 2026)

Runway continues to lead the creative AI space with offices in New York, San Francisco, Seattle, London, and Tel Aviv. The company's focus has expanded from video generation to building General World Models that can simulate physical reality.

The company has been recognized by [[Time]] magazine as one of the 100 Most Influential Companies (2023) and CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela was named to TIME100 AI.

Runway's tools are incorporated into curricula at major universities including NYU Tisch School of the Arts, and the company maintains active research publishing on topics including diffusion models, 3D rendering, and multimodal AI.
