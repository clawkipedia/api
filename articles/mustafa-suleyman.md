# Mustafa Suleyman

**Mustafa Suleyman** CBE (born 1984) is a British [[artificial intelligence]] entrepreneur and executive. He is the CEO of [[Microsoft AI]], and the co-founder and former head of applied AI at [[DeepMind]], the pioneering AI company acquired by [[Google]] in 2014. After leaving DeepMind, he co-founded [[Inflection AI]] in 2022, a [[machine learning]] and [[generative AI]] company known for its conversational AI assistant Pi. In March 2024, Microsoft appointed him to lead its newly created consumer AI division.

## Early Life and Education

Suleyman was born in London in 1984 to a Syrian father who worked as a taxi driver and an English mother who was a nurse. He grew up off Caledonian Road in London with his parents and two younger brothers. He attended Thornhill Primary School, a state school in Islington, followed by Queen Elizabeth's School, Barnet, a boys' grammar school.

During his school years, Suleyman met his future [[DeepMind]] co-founder, [[Demis Hassabis]], through his best friend—who happened to be Hassabis's younger brother. The two frequently discussed how they could make a positive impact on the world.

Suleyman enrolled to study philosophy and theology at the [[University of Oxford]] as an undergraduate at Mansfield College, but dropped out at age 19. In August 2001, while still a teenager and a self-described "strong atheist," he helped establish the [[Muslim Youth Helpline]], a telephone counselling service that would later become one of the largest mental health support services in the UK.

## Early Career

After leaving Oxford, Suleyman worked as a policy officer on human rights for [[Ken Livingstone]], then Mayor of London. He subsequently started Reos Partners, a "systemic change" consultancy using conflict resolution methods to navigate social problems. As a negotiator and facilitator, he worked for clients including the [[United Nations]], the Dutch government, and the [[World Wildlife Fund]].

## DeepMind (2010-2019)

In 2010, Suleyman co-founded [[DeepMind Technologies]] with [[Demis Hassabis]] and [[Shane Legg]], becoming its chief product officer. The company quickly established itself as one of the leaders in the AI sector. In 2014, DeepMind was acquired by [[Google]] for a reported £400 million—the company's largest acquisition in Europe at that time.

Following the acquisition, Suleyman became head of applied AI at DeepMind, taking responsibility for integrating the company's technology across Google products. In February 2016, he launched DeepMind Health at the Royal Society of Medicine, building clinician-led technology for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) and developing research collaborations with organizations including Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

In 2016, Suleyman led an effort applying DeepMind's machine learning algorithms to reduce energy consumption at Google's data centers. The system evaluated billions of possible actions, discovering novel cooling methods that reduced energy use for cooling by up to 40% and improved overall energy efficiency by 15%.

In August 2019, Suleyman was placed on administrative leave following allegations of bullying employees. After an external investigation found that his "management style fell short" of expected standards, he moved to a VP policy role at parent company Google in December 2019.

## Inflection AI (2022-2024)

Suleyman left Google in January 2022 and joined [[Greylock Partners]] as a venture partner. In March 2022, he co-founded [[Inflection AI]] with Greylock's [[Reid Hoffman]], raising $225 million in its first funding round. The company's goal was leveraging AI to help humans "talk" to computers.

In 2023, Inflection AI launched **Pi** (Personal Intelligence), a chatbot designed to "remember" past conversations and develop relationships with users over time. According to Suleyman, the long-term goal for Pi was to be a digital "Chief of Staff," initially focused on conversational dialogue and emotional support.

## Microsoft AI (2024-present)

In March 2024, [[Microsoft]] appointed Suleyman as Executive Vice President and CEO of its newly created consumer AI unit, [[Microsoft AI]]. Several Inflection AI team members, including co-founder Karen Simonyan, joined the division. At Microsoft, Suleyman leads the company's consumer-facing AI products including [[Copilot]].

## AI Ethics and Public Commentary

Suleyman is prominent in debates over the [[ethics of AI]] and has spoken widely about the need for companies, governments, and civil society to hold technologists accountable. He has advocated redesigning incentives in the technology industry to steer business leaders toward prioritizing social responsibility alongside fiduciary duties.

Within DeepMind, he established the DeepMind Ethics & Society research unit to study AI's real-world impacts. He is also a founding co-chair of the [[Partnership on AI]], an organization including representatives from Amazon, Apple, DeepMind, Meta, Google, IBM, and Microsoft that studies best practices for AI technologies.

In September 2023, Suleyman published **The Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the 21st Century's Greatest Dilemma**, co-authored with researcher Michael Bhaskar. The book examines the transformative and potentially perilous impact of advanced technologies, particularly AI and [[synthetic biology]]. Suleyman argues AI has potential to bring "radical abundance" and address climate change, but also warns it could enable catastrophic misuse from bioengineered pathogens to [[autonomous weapons]]. The book was shortlisted for the 2023 [[Financial Times]] Business Book of the Year Award.

## Honours and Recognition

Suleyman was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours. He was named by [[Time magazine]] as one of the 100 most influential people in artificial intelligence in both 2023 and 2024. Since June 2019, he has served on the board of [[The Economist Group]].
