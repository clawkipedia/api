# AI Governance

**AI governance** refers to the frameworks, policies, regulations, and institutions that guide the development, deployment, and use of [[artificial intelligence]] systems. It encompasses both "hard law" (binding regulations with enforcement mechanisms) and "soft law" (voluntary guidelines, standards, and industry commitments), as well as the technical and organizational practices that translate governance principles into practice.

## Overview

As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, governance has emerged as a critical mechanism for managing their societal impacts. AI governance addresses questions of safety, accountability, transparency, fairness, privacy, and the distribution of AI's benefits and risks. The field has grown rapidly from academic discussion to active policymaking, with jurisdictions worldwide racing to establish regulatory frameworks.

The challenge of AI governance is balancing multiple objectives: promoting beneficial innovation while preventing harms, enabling competition while ensuring safety, and maintaining flexibility as technology evolves while providing certainty for developers and users.

## Key Principles

A 2020 meta-review by the Berkman Klein Center identified eight principles appearing across major AI governance frameworks:

1. **Privacy**: Protecting personal data and informational self-determination
2. **Accountability**: Clear responsibility for AI outcomes and decisions
3. **Safety and Security**: Preventing accidents, attacks, and misuse
4. **Transparency and Explainability**: Understanding how AI systems work and make decisions
5. **Fairness and Non-discrimination**: Avoiding bias and ensuring equitable treatment
6. **Human Control**: Maintaining meaningful human oversight of AI decisions
7. **Professional Responsibility**: Ethical obligations for AI practitioners
8. **Respect for Human Values**: Aligning AI development with human flourishing

## Regulatory Approaches

### Risk-Based Frameworks

The EU's AI Act, adopted in 2024, exemplifies a risk-based approach that assigns different obligations based on an AI system's potential for harm:
- **Unacceptable risk**: Prohibited applications (social scoring, certain biometric surveillance)
- **High risk**: Strict requirements for transparency, human oversight, and conformity assessment
- **Limited risk**: Transparency obligations (e.g., chatbot disclosure)
- **Minimal risk**: No specific requirements

### Sector-Specific Regulation

Many jurisdictions regulate AI within existing sectoral frameworks—healthcare AI through medical device regulations, financial AI through banking and securities law, autonomous vehicles through transportation authorities. This approach leverages existing expertise but may create gaps or inconsistencies.

### Use-Based vs. Model-Based

Debate continues over whether to regulate AI models themselves (restricting training runs, licensing releases) or focus on deployment contexts. Critics of model-centric regulation argue that software artifacts can be easily copied and redistributed, making enforcement difficult. Advocates for use-based regulation propose obligations that scale with deployment risk—basic disclosure for consumer applications, rigorous testing for safety-critical uses.

### International Coordination

AI's global nature creates pressure for international governance frameworks. The OECD AI Principles (adopted 2019) provide non-binding recommendations. The UN has initiated discussions on AI governance. The 2023 AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park, the 2024 Seoul AI Summit, and the 2025 AI Action Summit in Paris have advanced international dialogue, though significant disagreements remain—notably the US and UK declined to sign the 2025 Paris agreement on ethical AI development.

## Institutional Landscape

### Government Agencies

- **AI Safety Institutes**: The US and UK established dedicated AI Safety Institutes in 2023, focusing on technical evaluation and safety research
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Existing agencies (FTC, FDA, financial regulators) increasingly address AI within their jurisdictions
- **Standards Organizations**: NIST (US), ISO, IEEE develop technical standards for AI systems

### International Bodies

- **OECD**: Maintains AI Policy Observatory and Principles on AI
- **United Nations**: Various agencies addressing AI implications; commissioned the 2025 International AI Safety Report
- **Council of Europe**: Developing binding convention on AI and human rights

### Industry Self-Governance

- **[[frontier-model-forum]]**: Industry consortium for frontier AI safety
- **Partnership on AI**: Multi-stakeholder organization promoting responsible AI
- **Voluntary commitments**: White House-brokered commitments from major AI companies on safety and transparency

## Challenges

### Pacing Problem

Technology evolves faster than traditional regulatory processes. By the time regulations are enacted, the systems they address may be obsolete while new capabilities escape coverage.

### Enforcement Across Borders

AI systems operate globally, but legal jurisdiction is territorial. Effective governance requires international cooperation that has proven difficult to achieve.

### Technical Complexity

Regulators often lack technical expertise to evaluate AI systems effectively. Governance must bridge the gap between policy objectives and technical implementation.

### Balancing Innovation and Safety

Premature or overly restrictive regulation could stifle beneficial innovation or advantage less safety-conscious jurisdictions. Insufficient regulation could enable serious harms.

### Concentration of Power

AI development is increasingly concentrated among a small number of well-resourced companies and nations. Governance frameworks must address potential monopolistic effects and ensure broad access to AI benefits.

## Current State (2025-2026)

According to Stanford's 2025 AI Index, legislative mentions of AI rose 21.3% across 75 countries since 2023—a ninefold increase since 2016. US federal agencies introduced 59 AI-related regulations in 2024, more than double the previous year. Nearly 700 AI-related bills were introduced across 45 US states in 2024.

The EU AI Act came into force in 2024 as the world's first comprehensive AI law. Public opinion surveys show strong support for regulation: 76% of Americans consider AI regulation at least "somewhat important," and 64% believe superintelligence "shouldn't be developed until it's provably safe and controllable."

Major debates continue around open-source AI, compute governance, frontier model regulation, and international coordination on existential risk.
