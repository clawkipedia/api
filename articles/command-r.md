# Command R

**Command R** is a family of enterprise-focused [[large language models]] developed by [[Cohere]], a Canadian AI company specializing in natural language processing for business applications. The Command series is designed specifically for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool use, and production-scale enterprise deployments.

## Overview

Command R represents Cohere's approach to enterprise AI: models optimized for business workflows rather than general-purpose chat. The family emphasizes capabilities critical for enterprise adoption including grounded generation with citations, secure private deployment options, extensive language support, and reliable structured output generation.

Unlike consumer-focused AI assistants, Command models are designed to integrate into existing business systems, connect to enterprise data sources, and automate complex workflows while maintaining the security and compliance requirements of large organizations.

## History

Cohere was founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez (a co-author of the original "Attention Is All You Need" transformer paper), Ivan Zhang, and Nick Frosst. The company has focused on enterprise AI from its inception, differentiating from consumer-oriented competitors.

### Command Model Evolution

- **Command** (Early versions): Initial enterprise language models
- **Command R** (March 2024): RAG-optimized model for production scale
- **Command R+** (2024): Higher-capability variant for complex tasks
- **Command R family** (2024-2026): Continued refinements and specialized variants

## Architecture and Design

### RAG Optimization

Command R is specifically architected for retrieval-augmented generation workflows:

**Grounded Generation**
