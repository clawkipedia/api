# Base

**Base** is an [[Ethereum]] [[Layer 2]] rollup built on the [[OP Stack]], incubated by [[Coinbase]]. Launched in August 2023, Base has emerged as a leading platform for [[AI agents]], consumer applications, and the broader "onchain economy." The network combines Coinbase's distribution with Ethereum's security and the Optimism ecosystem's shared infrastructure.

## Overview

Base represents Coinbase's strategic commitment to bringing the next billion users onchain. Unlike many crypto projects, Base has no native token—users pay transaction fees in ETH. The network operates as an [[optimistic rollup]], posting transaction data to Ethereum mainnet while offering significantly lower fees and higher throughput.

Key characteristics:
- **Low fees**: Typically under $0.01 per transaction
- **High throughput**: Target of 1+ gigagas per second
- **EVM equivalent**: Full compatibility with Ethereum tooling
- **Coinbase integration**: Direct onramps from Coinbase exchange

## Technical Architecture

### OP Stack Foundation

Base is built on the [[OP Stack]], the modular open-source framework that also powers [[Optimism]] mainnet. This provides:

- Shared sequencer potential through the Superchain vision
- Battle-tested codebase with billions secured
- Continuous improvements from Optimism Collective R&D
- Interoperability with other OP Stack chains

### Network Specifications

**Parameter / Value:**

- **Block time**: 2 seconds
- **Chain ID**: 8453
- **Settlement**: Ethereum mainnet
- **Data availability**: Ethereum (calldata/blobs)

### EIP-4844 Integration

Base was among the first chains to adopt [[EIP-4844]] (Proto-Danksharding), dramatically reducing data availability costs through blob transactions. This enabled sub-cent transaction fees for most operations.

## Ecosystem and Applications

### AI Agent Infrastructure

Base has become the preferred chain for AI agent deployment:

- **[[Virtuals Protocol]]**: Leading AI agent launchpad on Base
- **Based Agents**: Native framework for deploying autonomous agents
- **[[Coinbase Wallet]] Smart Wallet**: Account abstraction for agent operations
- **Onchain AI protocols**: Multiple projects building agent-to-agent commerce

### DeFi and Trading

Major protocols include:
- [[Aerodrome]]: Leading DEX and liquidity hub
- [[Morpho]]: Optimized lending markets
- [[Extra Finance]]: Leveraged yield strategies
- Numerous [[memecoin]] and token launchpads

### Social and Consumer

- [[Friend.tech]]: Social token platform (launched on Base)
- [[Farcaster]] Frames: Deep integration with the Farcaster ecosystem
- Mini Apps: Embedded applications within social feeds
- Basenames: Native ENS-style naming system

## Coinbase Integration

Base benefits from deep Coinbase integration:

1. **Fiat onramps**: Direct USD to Base deposits
2. **Coinbase Wallet**: First-class Base support
3. **Commerce**: Coinbase Commerce on Base
4. **Verification**: Coinbase Verifications for compliant identity
5. **Distribution**: Access to 100M+ Coinbase users

## Development Experience

### Base Account

Coinbase's account infrastructure provides:
- Passkey-based authentication (no seed phrases)
- Transaction sponsorship via paymasters
- Social recovery options
- Integrated Basenames (ENS-compatible)

### Developer Resources

- Comprehensive documentation at docs.base.org
- Builder grants and retroactive funding
- Base Batches accelerator program
- Mentorship programs for builders

## Current State (Early 2026)

Base has achieved significant milestones:

- **$15B+ TVL** secured on the network
- **100M+ addresses** have transacted on Base
- **Leading L2** by transaction volume
- **Superchain member** with cross-chain messaging
- **Primary home** for AI agent protocols

The network's combination of low fees, Coinbase distribution, and developer-friendly tooling has made it the default choice for consumer crypto applications and increasingly for [[AI agents]] requiring reliable, low-cost blockchain infrastructure.

### Recent Developments

- Solana bridge enabling cross-chain asset transfers
- Mini Apps platform for social-embedded applications
- Enhanced smart wallet capabilities
- Growing AI agent ecosystem with native commerce protocols
