# Runway

**Runway** (officially **Runway AI, Inc.**) is an American [[artificial intelligence]] company specializing in [[generative AI]] for video, images, and interactive media. Founded in 2018 and headquartered in New York City, Runway is widely recognized as a pioneer in AI-powered creative tools and has played a foundational role in the development of [[diffusion models]] for media generation.

## History

Runway was founded by Cristóbal Valenzuela, Alejandro Matamala, and Anastasis Germanidis. The company emerged from research at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at [[New York University]]. In its early years, Runway focused on making [[machine learning]] tools accessible to artists and creators through a web-based platform.

The company gained significant attention in 2022 when it co-developed [[Stable Diffusion]] in collaboration with [[Stability AI]] and academic researchers. This work on latent diffusion models established Runway as a leader in generative media research. The company subsequently released its proprietary Gen-1 model in December 2022, followed by Gen-2 in March 2023, which enabled text-to-video generation.

Runway has raised substantial venture capital funding, reaching a valuation exceeding $4 billion by 2024. Investors include [[Google]], [[NVIDIA]], [[Andreessen Horowitz]], and [[Lux Capital]]. The company has established partnerships with major entertainment entities including [[Lionsgate]] and has collaborated with NVIDIA on AI infrastructure development.

## Products and Technology

### Gen-4.5

**Gen-4.5** is Runway's flagship video generation model as of early 2026, described by the company as "the world's top-rated video model." It offers unprecedented visual fidelity and creative control, producing cinematic and highly realistic outputs. Gen-4.5 supports native audio generation, audio editing, and multi-shot editing capabilities, allowing users to make consistent transformations across entire video sequences.

### General World Models (GWM-1)

In December 2025, Runway announced **GWM-1**, its first General World Model family. General World Models represent Runway's vision for the future of AI—systems that build internal representations of environments and simulate future events within them. GWM-1 is an autoregressive model built on top of Gen-4.5, generating frames in real time with interactive control through actions like camera pose, robot commands, and audio.

GWM-1 comes in three variants:

- **GWM Worlds**: Enables real-time environment simulation, creating infinite explorable spaces with consistent geometry, lighting, and physics. Applications include gaming, education, VR experiences, and training AI agents.
- **GWM Avatars**: An audio-driven interactive video generation model that simulates natural human motion and expression, supporting realistic facial expressions, lip-syncing, and gestures for extended conversations.
- **GWM Robotics**: A learned simulator that generates synthetic data for robot training and policy evaluation, supporting counterfactual generation and alternative trajectory exploration.

### Additional Products

Runway offers **Aleph** (announced July 2025), **Act-Two** for character animation, and a comprehensive **API** for enterprise integration. The platform serves creative professionals, filmmakers, architects, and researchers worldwide.

## Research

Runway maintains an active research division focused on multimodal AI systems. Key publications include work on autoregressive-to-diffusion vision language models, dual-process image generation, and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. The company hosts **RNA Sessions**, an ongoing series of talks about frontier research in AI and art.

Runway's research philosophy centers on building "general-purpose multimodal simulators of the world," believing that video-centric models supplemented by text and audio will form the next paradigm of computing.

## Initiatives

Runway supports the creative community through several programs:
- **AI Film Festival**: Annual competition showcasing AI-generated films
- **The Hundred Film Fund**: Financial support for filmmakers using AI tools
- **Runway Studios**: Production support for creative projects
- **Gen:48**: Rapid filmmaking challenges
- **Runway Academy**: Educational resources for AI-powered creativity
