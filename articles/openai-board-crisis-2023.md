# OpenAI Board Crisis (November 2023)

The **OpenAI Board Crisis of November 2023** was a dramatic corporate governance upheaval at [[OpenAI]] in which co-founder and CEO [[Sam Altman]] was abruptly fired by the company's board of directors on November 17, 2023, only to be reinstated five days later following intense pressure from employees, investors, and partner [[Microsoft]]. The crisis exposed fundamental tensions between AI safety concerns and commercial ambitions at the world's most prominent AI company.

## Overview

On November 17, 2023, OpenAI's non-profit board of directors removed Altman as CEO, stating only that he was "not consistently candid in his communications" with the board. The sudden ouster triggered a cascade of resignations, a near-complete employee revolt, and negotiations involving Microsoft CEO [[Satya Nadella]].

Altman was briefly hired by Microsoft to lead a new AI research division before being reinstated at OpenAI on November 22 with a reconstituted board. The incident revealed the unusual corporate structure that placed a non-profit board in control of one of the world's most valuable AI companies.

## Background and Context

OpenAI's unique structure made such a crisis possible. The company operates through a non-profit entity (OpenAI, Inc.) that controls a capped-profit subsidiary (OpenAI Global, LLC). The non-profit board, designed to prioritize mission over investor returns, could remove any director without prior warning through written consent of a majority.

The board at the time consisted of chief scientist [[Ilya Sutskever]], entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, [[Adam D'Angelo]] (CEO of [[Quora]]), and [[Helen Toner]] (director at the [[Center for Security and Emerging Technology]]). Notably absent was anyone representing Microsoft's multi-billion-dollar investment in the company.

Under Altman's leadership since 2018, OpenAI had transformed from a research lab into a commercial powerhouse. The November 2022 launch of [[ChatGPT]] had made the company synonymous with the [[AI boom]], achieving an $80 billion valuation and projecting $1 billion in annual revenue.

## Events Leading to Removal

Multiple factors contributed to the board's decision. Internal documents and subsequent reporting revealed:

**Safety Concerns**: Divisions had grown between employees focused on commercial products and those prioritizing AI safety research. Reports emerged suggesting the removal was connected to a secretive project codenamed [[Q*]], related to AI mathematical reasoning, and concerns about Altman's handling of its safety implications.

**Reduced Role for Sutskever**: Altman had diminished Sutskever's responsibilities in October 2023, prompting the chief scientist to rally board allies against him.

**External Ventures**: Altman had been seeking billions from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds for AI chip development and discussing hardware projects with [[SoftBank]]'s [[Masayoshi Son]] and designer [[Jony Ive]]. Some board members viewed these as inappropriate use of the OpenAI brand.

**DevDay Concerns**: Altman's ambitious announcements at OpenAI's DevDay conference in early November, including custom ChatGPT instances, reportedly catalyzed opposition from board members concerned about rapid commercialization.

## The Five Chaotic Days

### November 17 (Friday)
At approximately noon Pacific Time, Altman was informed of his removal via Google Meet—given only five to ten minutes notice while watching the Las Vegas Grand Prix. President [[Greg Brockman]] learned thirty minutes later that he was being removed from the board (though not the company). Brockman immediately resigned, followed by other senior leaders including research director [[Jakub Pachocki]].

Chief Technology Officer [[Mira Murati]] was appointed interim CEO.

### November 18-19 (Weekend)
Investors including Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital lobbied for Altman's return. The board agreed in principle to resign and reinstate Altman but missed their own deadline. Microsoft and other investors prepared lists of potential new board members including former Salesforce executive [[Bret Taylor]].

Altman and Brockman appeared at OpenAI headquarters to negotiate, with Nadella mediating. Murati pushed for board restructuring and Altman's reinstatement.

### November 20 (Monday)
In a surprising move, the board named former [[Twitch]] CEO [[Emmett Shear]] as the new OpenAI CEO rather than reinstating Altman. Microsoft immediately announced that Altman would lead a new AI research team at the company, joined by Brockman and other departing OpenAI executives.

### November 20-21 (Employee Revolt)
A letter signed by 745 of OpenAI's approximately 770 employees demanded the board resign and threatened mass resignations. Remarkably, board member Sutskever signed the letter, publicly apologizing for his participation in Altman's removal and defecting to the employee faction.

### November 22 (Resolution)
Altman was reinstated as CEO with a new interim board consisting of Bret Taylor (as chair), Adam D'Angelo, and economist [[Lawrence Summers]]. Altman and Brockman did not rejoin the board, and Altman agreed to an internal investigation into his conduct.

## Aftermath and Investigation

In March 2024, the investigation concluded that Altman's behavior "did not mandate removal." He subsequently rejoined the expanded board alongside new members including former Gates Foundation CEO [[Sue Desmond-Hellmann]], former Sony general counsel [[Nicole Seligman]], and Instacart CEO [[Fidji Simo]].

Former board member Helen Toner later explained the board's original rationale, stating that Altman had withheld information about ChatGPT's launch timing, his ownership of OpenAI's startup fund, and the company's safety processes. She alleged that executives had reported "psychological abuse" by Altman, though she acknowledged the board handled communications poorly.

## Historical Significance

The November 2023 crisis revealed fundamental tensions in AI development between:

- **Safety and speed**: Researchers concerned about AI risks versus pressure for rapid deployment
- **Non-profit mission and commercial reality**: OpenAI's founding ideals versus its evolution into a major business
- **Governance and capital**: A mission-focused board versus billions in investor capital seeking returns

The episode also demonstrated the concentrated power of a few individuals in shaping AI development—and how fragile that concentration could be. The board's attempt to redirect OpenAI's trajectory was overwhelmed within days by employee loyalty, investor pressure, and competitive dynamics.
