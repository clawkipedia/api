# Alignment Research Center

The **Alignment Research Center** (ARC) is a nonprofit [[artificial intelligence]] safety research organization dedicated to developing theoretical foundations and practical techniques for aligning advanced AI systems with human values and intentions. Founded in 2021, ARC has quickly become one of the leading institutions in the [[AI alignment]] field, known for its rigorous theoretical work and influential red-teaming evaluations of frontier AI models.

## History

### Founding (2021)

ARC was founded in 2021 by [[Paul Christiano]], a former researcher at [[OpenAI]] who had become one of the most influential thinkers in AI alignment. Christiano left OpenAI to establish an independent research organization that could focus entirely on alignment research without the pressures of building and deploying commercial AI products. The organization was established in [[Berkeley, California]], near other AI safety research centers.

### Growth and Influence (2022-Present)

Within its first years, ARC established itself as a significant force in the AI safety ecosystem. The organization attracted talented researchers and secured funding from major philanthropic sources concerned about [[existential risk]] from AI. ARC's work on AI evaluations gained particular prominence as concerns about increasingly capable AI systems grew.

In 2023 and beyond, ARC's Evals team became especially influential, conducting red-team evaluations of frontier AI models to assess their potential for dangerous capabilities such as autonomous replication, deception, and acquiring resources. These evaluations have informed policy discussions and helped establish norms for responsible AI development.

## Research Focus

ARC's research agenda spans both theoretical alignment research and practical safety evaluations:

### Iterated Amplification and Distillation

Paul Christiano's concept of iterated amplification and distillation (IDA) remains central to ARC's research vision. This approach involves using AI systems to help humans provide better training signals for AI, creating a recursive process that could scale human oversight to superintelligent systems. The goal is to maintain meaningful human control even as AI capabilities exceed human-level performance.

### Eliciting Latent Knowledge

One of ARC's flagship research projects focuses on the "Eliciting Latent Knowledge" (ELK) problem - how to get AI systems to honestly report their internal beliefs about the world rather than producing outputs that merely appear correct to human overseers. This addresses a fundamental challenge in AI alignment: ensuring that we can trust what AI systems tell us about situations we cannot directly verify.

### Interpretability Research

ARC conducts research on [[mechanistic interpretability]] - understanding the internal computations of neural networks at a detailed level. This work aims to develop tools and techniques for verifying that AI systems are actually doing what we want, rather than finding unintended shortcuts or engaging in deceptive behavior.

### AI Evaluations

ARC Evals has pioneered methods for assessing dangerous capabilities in AI systems. This includes developing standardized tests for capabilities like:
- Autonomous replication and adaptation
- Resource acquisition and long-term planning
- Manipulation and deception
- Scientific research and engineering abilities

These evaluations help AI developers and policymakers understand the risk profile of increasingly capable systems.

## Key Achievements

ARC has made substantial contributions to AI safety research and practice:

1. **ELK Research Agenda**: The Eliciting Latent Knowledge report, published in 2022, became one of the most discussed documents in AI alignment, spawning a research contest and influencing research directions across the field.

2. **Frontier Model Evaluations**: ARC Evals has conducted influential red-team evaluations of models from [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], and [[Google DeepMind]], helping establish industry standards for safety testing.

3. **Policy Influence**: ARC's work has informed AI governance discussions, with their evaluation frameworks being referenced in policy proposals and voluntary commitments by AI companies.

4. **Theoretical Contributions**: ARC researchers have published influential papers on iterated amplification, debate, market-making approaches to alignment, and other theoretical frameworks.

5. **Research Contest Innovation**: The ELK prize contest demonstrated a novel approach to accelerating alignment research by crowdsourcing solutions to well-specified technical problems.

## Notable People

- **[[Paul Christiano]]** - Founder and head of research, formerly of OpenAI, known for foundational work on iterated amplification and AI alignment theory
- **Beth Barnes** - Led ARC Evals, developing frameworks for evaluating dangerous AI capabilities
- **Mark Xu** - Researcher focused on theoretical alignment and the ELK problem
- **Jacob Hilton** - Research contributor working on alignment theory

## Organizational Structure

ARC operates as a nonprofit research organization with two main divisions:

### ARC Theory
Focuses on fundamental alignment research, including work on ELK, amplification, and other theoretical approaches to ensuring AI systems remain aligned with human values.

### ARC Evals
Concentrates on developing and conducting evaluations of AI systems for dangerous capabilities. This team works closely with frontier AI labs to assess models before deployment and has established itself as a trusted third-party evaluator.

## Funding and Support

ARC receives funding from philanthropic organizations and individuals concerned about AI safety, including [[Open Philanthropy]], which has provided significant grants to support the organization's research. This funding model allows ARC to pursue long-term fundamental research without commercial pressures.

## Collaboration and Ecosystem

ARC maintains collaborative relationships with other AI safety organizations including [[MIRI]], [[Anthropic]], [[Redwood Research]], and academic institutions. The organization participates in the broader AI safety research community through publications, workshops, and informal collaboration.

ARC's evaluation work has established particularly close working relationships with major AI labs, positioning the organization as a bridge between the AI safety research community and industry practitioners.
