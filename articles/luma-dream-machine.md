# Dream Machine

**Dream Machine** is a [[text-to-video model]] and creative platform developed by [[Luma Labs]], a San Francisco-based [[generative artificial intelligence]] company. Launched on June 12, 2024, Dream Machine enables users to create videos from text prompts or still images, and has evolved to become a comprehensive creative suite for ideation, image generation, and video production.

## Overview

Luma Labs was founded with the mission of building "multimodal general intelligence that can generate, understand, and operate in the physical world." Prior to Dream Machine, the company had developed Genie, a [[3D model]] generator. Dream Machine represented the company's expansion into video generation, an area that had seen significant anticipation following [[OpenAI]]'s announcement of [[Sora]].

Dream Machine launched publicly on June 12, 2024, announced via a post on [[X (platform)|X]] alongside demonstration videos. Notably, it became available to general users immediately without a waiting list, distinguishing it from Sora which remained in limited preview. This accessibility drove rapid adoption and viral content creation on social media platforms.

The platform operates on a subscription model with free, Standard, Pro, and Premier tiers, offering between 30 and 2,000 monthly video generations depending on the plan.

## Technology

Dream Machine is powered by a succession of increasingly capable models:

- **Original Dream Machine** (June 2024): Generated 5-second videos at 1360×752 pixels
- **Ray2** (2025): Second-generation model with fast coherent motion, ultra-realistic details, and logical event sequences
- **Ray3** (October 2025): Next-generation reasoning video model developed in collaboration with entertainment, advertising, and gaming industry creatives
- **Ray3.14** (2026): Latest update adding native 1080p generation, 4x faster performance, improved stability, and 3x lower cost

The platform also includes **Photon**, a creative and personalizable [[text-to-image model]] delivering ultra-high quality at 10x cost efficiency compared to competitors.

Luma Labs has published research on innovations including "Inductive Moment Matching" and "Terminal Velocity Matching" for efficient inference-time scaling, indicating significant investment in foundational AI research.

## Capabilities

Dream Machine offers a comprehensive creative toolkit:

- **Text-to-Video**: Generate videos directly from natural language descriptions
- **Image-to-Video**: Animate static images into dynamic video sequences
- **Video-to-Video**: Modify existing videos with character reference and keyframe controls
- **Modify Video**: Transform video content while maintaining subject consistency
- **Draft Mode**: Rapid exploration and iteration at reduced cost
- **HDR Pipeline**: First-to-market HDR video generation for enhanced visual fidelity
- **Character Reference**: Maintain consistent character appearance across scenes
- **Keyframe Control**: Direct specific moments in the generated video

The platform emphasises an uninterrupted creative workflow, allowing users to move fluidly between ideation, image generation, and video creation within a single interface. An iOS app complements the web-based platform.

## Reception

Upon release, Dream Machine generated substantial attention and creative experimentation. Users quickly began animating [[Midjourney]]-generated images and recreating famous artworks and memes in video form, including the [[Girl with a Pearl Earring]], [[Doge (meme)|Doge]], and the [[distracted boyfriend]] meme. These viral creations spread across social media, demonstrating both the platform's capabilities and limitations.

[[Tom's Guide]] called Dream Machine "one of the best prompt following and motion understanding AI video models yet" and "an impressive next step in generative AI video," while noting continued room for improvement. [[Mashable]] described user-created videos as "eerily-moving" and "Harry Potter-esque."

However, the platform faced criticism regarding training data transparency. [[The Verge]]'s Charles Pulliam-Moore noted that Dream Machine's training data was not publicly disclosed, raising questions about potential copyright concerns. A viral "Monster Camp" trailer that appeared to incorporate [[Monsters, Inc. (franchise)|Monsters, Inc.]] aesthetics and characters drew particular scrutiny.

[[TechRadar]] observed that the unclear training data provenance "means that its potential outside of personal use or improving your GIF game could be limited," while acknowledging it as "a taster of the more advanced (and no doubt more expensive) AI video generators to come."

The platform has built a substantial Learning Hub community featuring tutorials, best practices, and examples from millions of creatives using Dream Machine across design, film, education, and other fields.
