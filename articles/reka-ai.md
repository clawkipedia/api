# Reka AI

**Reka AI** is an American [[artificial intelligence]] company specializing in [[multimodal AI]] systems, founded by former [[Google DeepMind]] researchers. The company develops AI models designed for understanding and generating content across multiple modalities including text, images, video, and audio, with a focus on practical enterprise applications and open-source research contributions.

## Overview

Reka AI builds multimodal foundation models optimized for real-world deployment across enterprise and consumer applications. The company emphasizes three core capabilities: true multimodal understanding (processing text, images, video, and audio natively), flexible deployment options (cloud, edge, and on-device), and domain-specific fine-tuning for specialized use cases.

## History

### Founding

Reka AI was founded by researchers who previously worked at [[Google DeepMind]], bringing expertise in large-scale AI systems and multimodal learning. The founding team includes researchers with significant contributions to transformer architectures and multimodal AI research.

The company emerged during the rapid expansion of the generative AI industry, positioning itself as a specialist in multimodal systems rather than competing directly with text-focused LLM providers.

### Development

Reka has focused on building models that can understand and reason across different types of input—a capability that has become increasingly important as AI applications move beyond pure text processing. The company has released both research papers and open-source components while developing commercial enterprise solutions.

## Technology and Products

### Core Models

Reka develops a family of multimodal models designed for different use cases and deployment scenarios:

- **Enterprise-grade models**: Full-featured multimodal systems for complex reasoning
- **Lightweight variants**: Optimized for on-device and edge deployment

### Key Capabilities

**True Multimodal Processing:**
- Native understanding of images, video, audio, and text
- Cross-modal reasoning (e.g., answering questions about video content)
- Multi-turn conversations with mixed media inputs

**Flexible Deployment:**
- Cloud deployment via API
- On-premises enterprise solutions
- Edge and mobile device deployment
- Custom integration support

**Domain Fine-Tuning:**
- Industry-specific model customization
- Proprietary data training
- Specialized application development

### Products and Services

**For Developers:**
- RESTful APIs with SDKs for Python, JavaScript, and other languages
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Sample applications for common use cases
- Playground for testing model capabilities

**For Enterprise:**
- Custom model development
- Security and compliance support
- Dedicated implementation assistance
- SLA-backed production deployments

### Product Lines

- **Reka Vision**: Image and video understanding
- **Reka Research**: Advanced research models
- **Reka Space**: Spatial and 3D understanding
- **Reka Speech**: Audio processing and speech understanding
- **Reka Clip**: Consumer-facing creative application
- **Reka for Creators**: Tools for content creation

## Open Source Contributions

Reka maintains an "Open Source by Design" philosophy, releasing key research components:
- Reasoning model implementations
- Evaluation tools and benchmarks
- Code models
- Quantization infrastructure

These contributions aim to advance the broader AI research community while establishing Reka's technical credibility.

## Current State (Early 2026)

Reka AI continues to develop multimodal AI systems for enterprise and consumer applications. The company operates a developer platform with API access, enterprise solutions, and consumer products including Reka Clip.

The company maintains active research programs and community engagement through documentation, events, and open-source releases. Reka positions itself as a specialist in multimodal AI—a growing segment as applications increasingly require understanding of images, video, and audio alongside text.

The founding team's DeepMind pedigree provides technical credibility, while the company's focus on practical deployment differentiates it from pure research organizations. Reka competes in a market that includes [[Google DeepMind]]'s Gemini, [[OpenAI]]'s GPT-4V, and [[Anthropic]]'s Claude—all of which have added multimodal capabilities to their core language models.
