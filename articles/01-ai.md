# 01.AI

**01.AI** (Chinese: 零一万物, pinyin: *Língyī Wànwù*) is a Chinese [[artificial intelligence]] company founded in March 2023 by [[Kai-Fu Lee]], former executive at [[Microsoft]] and [[Google]] and co-founder of [[Sinovation Ventures]]. The company is known for developing the Yi series of [[open source]] [[large language models]], which have achieved leading performance while using dramatically fewer computational resources than competitors. Headquartered in [[Beijing]], 01.AI achieved [[unicorn]] status within eight months of launching.

## Overview

The company's name "零一万物" translates to "zero-one, everything," alluding to a passage from the [[Taoist]] text *[[Tao Te Ching]]*. 01.AI's stated vision is to "Make AGI Accessible and Beneficial to Everyone," with a focus on the "AI 2.0" paradigm driven by [[foundation model]] breakthroughs.

01.AI has distinguished itself through remarkable efficiency, training competitive models with a fraction of the resources used by major American AI labs. The company reportedly trained a [[GPT-4]]-competitive model with just 2,000 [[GPU|GPUs]] at a cost of $3 million, compared to OpenAI's estimated $80-100 million for similar capabilities.

## History

### Founding and Chip Acquisition (2023)

01.AI was founded in March 2023 by Kai-Fu Lee amid increasing [[US export controls on semiconductors]] to China. Anticipating supply constraints, Lee began amassing semiconductors early in the year, even borrowing money from Sinovation Ventures to fund the purchases.

Due to limited chip availability, 01.AI developed highly efficient AI infrastructure and inference engines to maximize training effectiveness. The company achieved a chip-cluster failure rate lower than industry average, enabling more reliable training runs.

### Rapid Rise to Unicorn Status (2023)

01.AI commenced operations in June 2023. Within just eight months of launching, the company achieved a valuation over $1 billion in November 2023, giving it [[unicorn]] status. At that time, the company had a team of over 100 employees.

The company chose to build [[open source]] models because the vast majority of AI developers cannot afford or do not require the largest and most expensive proprietary models. However, 01.AI also planned to develop proprietary models for enterprise customers.

### External Investment

01.AI attracted backing from major Chinese technology companies including [[Alibaba Group]] and [[Xiaomi]].

### Strategic Pivot (2024-2025)

In October 2024, it was reported that 01.AI was implementing cost-reduction strategies including focusing on smaller, more efficient datasets and hiring more cost-effective engineers.

In January 2025, Lee denied rumors that 01.AI was negotiating to sell its pre-training team to [[Alibaba Cloud]].

In March 2025, 01.AI made a significant strategic shift, stopping "pre-training" of large language models to focus on selling tailored AI business solutions. The company began building on [[DeepSeek]]'s models rather than training its own foundation models from scratch, reflecting the broader trend of Chinese AI startups adapting their business models after DeepSeek's success.

## Products and Technology

### Yi Models

Yi is 01.AI's series of open source large language models, available in both Chinese and English.

**Yi-34B** (November 2023):
- Named for its 34 billion parameters
- Outperformed other open-source models including [[Meta AI]]'s [[Llama 2]] on key metrics
- Ranked first on [[Hugging Face]] for pre-trained base LLMs at release
- Available to developers worldwide

**Yi-Coder** (September 2024):
- Coding assistant supporting 52 [[programming languages]]
- Available in 9 billion and 1.5 billion parameter versions
- Notable 128,000 token context length for processing large code snippets

**Yi-Lightning** (October 2024):
- Highly competitive model ranked joint third among LLM companies by [[UC Berkeley]] SkyLab and LMSYS researchers
- Tied with [[xAI]]'s [[Grok|Grok-2]], behind only [[OpenAI]] and [[Google]]
- Dramatically cost-effective: inference costs 14 cents per million tokens vs. 26 cents for OpenAI's GPT o1-mini

### Wanzhi

Launched in May 2024, Wanzhi is a free productivity assistant described as comparable to [[Microsoft Copilot]]. Available in Chinese and English versions, it represents 01.AI's consumer-facing AI application.

## Technical Approach

01.AI's approach emphasizes efficiency over scale. Key innovations include:

- **Efficient Infrastructure**: Developed optimized AI infrastructure to compensate for limited chip supply
- **Cost-Effective Training**: Achieved GPT-4-class performance with $3 million in training costs using just 2,000 GPUs
- **Open Source Philosophy**: Democratizing AI by making powerful models freely available
- **Smaller Dataset Focus**: Concentrating on quality and efficiency rather than raw scale

The company has advocated for the "AI 2.0" vision, predicting that AI will create a platform opportunity ten times larger than mobile internet, rewriting all software and user interfaces.

## Funding

01.AI achieved unicorn status ($1 billion+ valuation) in November 2023, within eight months of founding. The company received backing from:

- [[Alibaba Group]]
- [[Xiaomi]]
- [[Sinovation Ventures]] (founding investor)

Specific funding round details have not been publicly disclosed.
