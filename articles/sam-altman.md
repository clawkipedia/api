# Sam Altman

**Samuel Harris Altman** (born April 22, 1985) is an American entrepreneur and businessman who serves as CEO of [[OpenAI]], the artificial intelligence research organization behind [[ChatGPT]]. Having overseen the successful launch of ChatGPT in 2022, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, Altman is widely considered one of the leading figures of the [[AI boom]] and one of the most influential—and controversial—executives in Silicon Valley.

## Overview

Altman's career trajectory—from Stanford dropout to startup founder to Y Combinator president to OpenAI CEO—exemplifies the Silicon Valley path to power. His leadership of OpenAI has made him a central figure in debates about AI's future, appearing before Congress, meeting world leaders, and surviving a dramatic boardroom ouster that lasted only five days. As of early 2026, Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.1 billion, and he was named among Time's "Architects of AI" for Person of the Year 2025.

## Early Life and Education

Altman was born in Chicago to a Jewish family. His mother Connie Gibstine is a dermatologist, and his father Jerry was a real estate broker. At age eight, he received his first computer—an Apple Macintosh—and taught himself to code. The family moved to Clayton, Missouri, when Altman was four, and he attended John Burroughs School, a private institution.

Altman studied computer science at Stanford University for two years before dropping out in 2005 to co-found Loopt, a location-based social networking app, at age 19.

## Career

### Loopt and Y Combinator

Loopt raised over $30 million in venture capital, including early investments from [[Peter Thiel]], who became Altman's mentor. The company was acquired by Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million in 2012 after failing to gain significant user traction.

In 2011, Altman joined [[Y Combinator]] as a partner and became president in 2014, aiming to fund 1,000 startups per year. He expanded YC's focus to include "hard technology" startups and established YC Research. Altman transitioned away from YC in 2019 to focus on OpenAI, though his departure involved some controversy over claims about his role.

### OpenAI

Altman was a co-founder of [[OpenAI]] in 2015, alongside [[Elon Musk]], [[Greg Brockman]], and others. The organization launched with $1 billion in pledged funding (though only $130 million was collected by 2019) and a mission focused on AI safety and beneficial artificial general intelligence.

In March 2019, Altman became OpenAI's CEO full-time. Under his leadership, OpenAI released increasingly powerful AI systems, culminating in [[ChatGPT]] in December 2022. The chatbot received over a million signups within five days and sparked the current AI boom.

#### The November 2023 Crisis

On November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board—including chief scientist [[Ilya Sutskever]]—announced Altman's removal as CEO, citing that he "was not consistently candid in his communications with the board." [[Greg Brockman]] resigned in protest.

The move triggered immediate backlash. Microsoft CEO [[Satya Nadella]] announced Altman would join Microsoft to lead a new AI research team. Over 700 of OpenAI's 770 employees signed an open letter threatening to leave unless Altman was reinstated—including Sutskever, who expressed regret. Five days later, Altman returned as CEO with a reconstituted board led by [[Bret Taylor]].

Former board member [[Helen Toner]] later revealed concerns about Altman withholding information from the board, including not disclosing ChatGPT's release in advance, and allegations of "psychological abuse" reported by executives.

### Other Ventures

Altman maintains an extensive investment portfolio valued at approximately $2.8 billion, including stakes in over 400 companies. Notable investments include:

- **Worldcoin/Tools For Humanity** (2019): Eye-scanning cryptocurrency project that has faced regulatory scrutiny in multiple countries
- **Helion Energy**: Nuclear fusion company (served as chairman)
- **Oklo Inc.**: Nuclear fission startup (chairman until April 2025)
- **Reddit**: Third-largest shareholder prior to 2024 IPO
- **Hydrazine Capital**: Venture fund co-founded with his brother Jack

He also briefly served as Reddit CEO for eight days in 2014.

## Political Engagement

Altman has been politically active across the spectrum. He considered running for California governor in 2018, hosted fundraisers for Andrew Yang (2019) and Mark Warner (2025), donated $250,000 to a Biden super PAC (2020), and contributed $1 million to Trump's 2025 inaugural fund. In July 2025, he described himself as "politically homeless," criticizing the Democratic Party for no longer encouraging "innovation and entrepreneurship."

He is a proponent of universal basic income and land value taxation, proposing "universal basic compute" to give everyone access to AI computing power.

## Personal Life

Altman is openly gay, having come out at age 17. He dated Loopt co-founder Nick Sivo for nine years. In January 2024, he married Oliver Mulherin, an engineer he met "in Peter Thiel's hot tub at 3 a.m." in 2015. The couple has a son born in 2025 and signed The Giving Pledge in May 2024.

Altman is a self-described "apocalypse preparer," stating in 2016: "I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israel Defense Forces, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to."

In January 2025, Altman's sister Ann filed a lawsuit alleging childhood sexual abuse. Altman and his family issued a joint statement calling the allegations "utterly untrue."
