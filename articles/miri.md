# Machine Intelligence Research Institute

**Machine Intelligence Research Institute** (MIRI), formerly the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), is a [[nonprofit]] research institute focused on identifying and managing potential [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence]]. Founded in 2000 and headquartered in Berkeley, California, MIRI conducts technical research on [[AI alignment]] and [[friendly artificial intelligence]], with the goal of ensuring that advanced AI systems remain beneficial to humanity.

## Overview

MIRI's research addresses fundamental questions about how to design AI systems that reliably pursue intended goals and remain under human control even as they become more capable. The institute takes a long-term, precautionary approach to AI safety, working on problems that may become critical as AI systems approach and exceed human-level capabilities.

The organization aligns itself with the principles of the [[effective altruism]] movement, prioritizing research with high potential impact on long-term outcomes for humanity.

## History

### Founding and Early Years (2000-2005)

MIRI was founded in 2000 as the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] with funding from Brian and Sabine Atkins. The original purpose was to accelerate the development of [[artificial intelligence]].

However, Yudkowsky became concerned that future AI systems could become [[superintelligent]] and pose risks to humanity. In 2005, the institute relocated from Atlanta to Silicon Valley and pivoted to focus on identifying and managing AI risks—concerns that were largely ignored by mainstream AI researchers at the time.

### Singularity Summit Era (2006-2012)

Starting in 2006, the institute organized the [[Singularity Summit]] to discuss the future of AI and its risks. The first conference was held in cooperation with [[Stanford University]] with funding from [[Peter Thiel]]. The [[San Francisco Chronicle]] described it as "a Bay Area coming-out party for the tech-inspired philosophy called [[transhumanism]]."

By 2011, MIRI operated from four apartments in downtown Berkeley.

In December 2012, the institute sold its name, web domain, and the Singularity Summit to [[Singularity University]], subsequently rebranding as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in January 2013.

### Growth and Recognition (2014-Present)

In 2014 and 2015, public and scientific interest in AI risks grew significantly, increasing donations to MIRI and similar organizations. Major funders have included:

- **[[Open Philanthropy]]**: $2.1 million grant (2019) for general support over two years, followed by a $7.7 million grant (April 2020) over two years
- **[[Vitalik Buterin]]**: Several million dollars worth of [[Ethereum]] (2021)

## Research and Approach

### Core Focus Areas

MIRI's research, led by Yudkowsky, primarily addresses:

1. **Friendly AI Design**: How to initially design AI systems that are beneficial to humanity
2. **Value Alignment**: Ensuring AI systems pursue goals aligned with human values
3. **Corrigibility**: Creating mechanisms that allow AI systems to be corrected and remain under human control
4. **AI Control Problem**: Preventing advanced AI from taking actions harmful to humanity

### Technical Research

MIRI researchers have published work on:

- **Decision theory**: Novel approaches to AI decision-making
- **Logical uncertainty**: Handling uncertainty in formal reasoning
- **Agent foundations**: Fundamental theory of intelligent agents
- **Program equilibrium**: Game-theoretic analysis using computational agents

### AI Impacts

MIRI has funded forecasting work through AI Impacts, an initiative studying:

- Historical instances of discontinuous technological change
- Measures of relative computational power between humans and computer hardware
- Timelines for artificial general intelligence development

### Precautionary Approach

MIRI researchers advocate early safety work as a precautionary measure, arguing that by the time AI systems become powerful enough to pose serious risks, it may be too late to develop adequate safety measures. However, MIRI researchers have expressed skepticism about predictions by [[singularity advocates]] like [[Ray Kurzweil]] that [[superintelligence]] is imminent.

## Key People

- **[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]**: Founder and senior research fellow. Prolific writer on AI safety, rationality, and related topics. Co-author of "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies: Why Superhuman AI Would Kill Us All" (2025)
- **Nate Soares**: Executive Director. Has presented on AI alignment at organizations including [[Google]]

## Notable Publications

MIRI staff have published influential work on AI safety:

- "Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk" (Yudkowsky, 2008)
- "Complex Value Systems in Friendly AI" (Yudkowsky, 2011)
- "Aligning Superintelligence with Human Interests: A Technical Research Agenda" (Soares & Fallenstein, 2015)
- "Corrigibility" (Soares, Fallenstein, Yudkowsky & Armstrong, 2015)
- "Quantilizers: A Safer Alternative to Maximizers for Limited Optimization" (Taylor, 2016)
- "Cheating Death in Damascus" (Soares & Levinstein, 2017)
- "Why We Should Be Concerned About Artificial Superintelligence" (Graves, 2017)
- "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies" (Yudkowsky & Soares, 2025)

## Influence and Legacy

MIRI played a pioneering role in establishing AI safety as a legitimate field of research. When the institute began focusing on AI risks in 2005, these concerns were largely dismissed by mainstream AI researchers. The subsequent growth of AI safety as a recognized discipline, with research programs at major universities and AI labs, reflects the changing perception of these issues.

The institute's early work laid conceptual foundations that influenced later research at organizations including [[OpenAI]], [[Anthropic]], and [[Google DeepMind]].
