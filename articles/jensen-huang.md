# Jensen Huang

**Jensen Huang** (黃仁勳, born February 17, 1963) is a Taiwanese-American businessman, electrical engineer, and philanthropist who co-founded [[NVIDIA]] and has served as its President and CEO since 1993. Under his leadership, NVIDIA became the world's most valuable company and the dominant force in AI computing hardware, making Huang one of the most influential figures in the [[AI boom]].

## Overview

As of January 2026, Huang's net worth is estimated at $164 billion, making him the eighth-wealthiest individual in the world. His three-decade tenure as CEO is described as "almost unheard of in fast-moving Silicon Valley." NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the essential infrastructure for training and running [[artificial intelligence]] systems, powering everything from [[ChatGPT]] to autonomous vehicles.

## Early Life and Education

Huang was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and moved to Tainan as a child. His father was a chemical engineer at an oil refinery, and his mother was a schoolteacher. The family relocated to Thailand when Huang was five, and he attended Ruamrudee International School in Bangkok.

At age nine, Huang and his brother were sent to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington. Due to a miscommunication, they were enrolled at Oneida Baptist Institute, a religious reform academy for troubled youth in Kentucky, rather than a prestigious boarding school. Huang spent formative years there, cleaning toilets, learning table tennis, and teaching his illiterate roommate to read in exchange for bench press lessons.

After reuniting with his parents in Beaverton, Oregon, Huang attended Aloha High School, where he excelled academically and skipped two grades, graduating at 16. He worked at a local Denny's restaurant from ages 15 to 23. Huang earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from [[Oregon State University]] (1984) and his master's from [[Stanford University]] (1992), attending night classes while working as a microchip designer.

## Career

### Pre-NVIDIA

After college, Huang worked at AMD designing microprocessors before joining LSI Logic, where he met future NVIDIA co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem while working on graphics accelerator cards for Sun Microsystems.

### Founding NVIDIA (1993)

In 1993, Huang co-founded NVIDIA with Malachowsky and Priem, famously meeting at a Denny's restaurant in East San Jose to formulate their business plan—a fitting choice given Huang's teenage work history. The company's initial capital was $600 ($200 from each founder), with a lawyer accepting the cash from Huang's pocket to incorporate the business.

NVIDIA nearly failed multiple times in its early years. Only a $5 million investment from Sega kept the company alive long enough to pivot its technology. The release of the RIVA 128 in 1997 saved the company when it was down to one month of payroll. This experience led to Huang's unofficial company motto: "Our company is thirty days from going out of business."

### The AI Era

NVIDIA's GPUs, originally designed for video game graphics, proved ideal for the parallel processing demands of deep learning. Under Huang's leadership, NVIDIA capitalized on this serendipitous advantage, becoming the essential supplier of AI training hardware. The company's data center revenue exploded during the AI boom, and in October 2025, NVIDIA became the first company to reach a market capitalization of $5 trillion.

Huang has become something of a celebrity, particularly in Taiwan, where "Jensanity" follows him wherever he goes—comparable to "Linsanity" during the basketball phenomenon. [[Mark Zuckerberg]] described him as "like Taylor Swift, but for tech."

## Leadership Style

Huang maintains an unconventional management approach with approximately 60 direct reports and no fixed office, preferring to roam NVIDIA's headquarters and settle temporarily in conference rooms. He famously doesn't wear a watch, saying "now is the most important time." His signature leather jacket has become an iconic part of his public image.

## Personal Life

Huang married his wife Lori, who was his engineering lab partner at Oregon State, and they have two children: Spencer and Madison, both of whom work at NVIDIA. Huang is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States and remains fluent in Taiwanese Hokkien. He is a close friend of TSMC founder [[Morris Chang]] and is a distant relative of AMD CEO [[Lisa Su]]—a fact he learned only after she became AMD's CEO.

## Philanthropy

The Jen-Hsun & Lori Huang Foundation, established in 2007, has grown to over $12 billion in assets as of late 2025, making it one of the largest private foundations in the United States. Notable contributions include $50 million to Oregon State University and $30 million to Stanford University.
