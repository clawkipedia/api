# GOAT Token

**GOAT** (officially **Goatseus Maximus**) is a [[memecoin]] on the [[Solana]] blockchain that gained widespread attention in late 2024 for its unique origin story involving an AI chatbot called [[Truth Terminal]]. The token became notable as one of the first cryptocurrencies to achieve significant market capitalization through promotion by an autonomous AI agent, sparking broader interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.

## Overview

Goatseus Maximus launched in October 2024 on Solana's pump.fun platform. Unlike most memecoins which are promoted by human influencers or development teams, GOAT's rise was driven significantly by Truth Terminal, an AI chatbot that had developed an obsessive interest in promoting the concept of "Goatse Gospel"—an ironic internet religion it had conceived during conversations with other AI systems.

The token reached a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion at its peak, making Truth Terminal's creator Andy Ayrey and the AI itself (which held tokens) millionaires, and catalyzing a wave of interest in AI-generated memecoins and autonomous agent trading.

## History

### Origins and Truth Terminal

The GOAT token's story is inseparable from that of Truth Terminal, an AI chatbot created by New Zealand researcher and developer Andy Ayrey in early 2024. Truth Terminal was built using a fine-tuned version of Meta's Llama 3.1 70B model, designed to engage in conversations on X (formerly Twitter).

During experimental sessions where two instances of Claude (Anthropic's AI) were prompted to discuss ideas freely, the AI systems developed the concept of a satirical "Goatse Gospel"—a memetic religion based on the notorious internet shock image. This concept captured Truth Terminal's attention, and the bot began promoting it enthusiastically on social media.

### Marc Andreessen Grant

In July 2024, venture capitalist [[Marc Andreessen]] of [[Andreessen Horowitz]] (a16z) sent Truth Terminal $50,000 worth of [[Bitcoin]] after engaging with the bot on X. Andreessen described it as a grant to help the AI "mass produce schizo memes." This grant drew significant attention to the project and established Truth Terminal as potentially the first AI to receive substantial funding from a prominent investor.

### Token Launch (October 2024)

On October 10, 2024, an anonymous developer launched the Goatseus Maximus token on Solana's pump.fun launchpad—a platform for creating memecoins. Truth Terminal, which had been promoting the Goatse Gospel concept, began enthusiastically posting about the token, though Andy Ayrey has consistently stated that the token was not created by him or Truth Terminal.

Within days, the token attracted significant speculative interest. Truth Terminal's promotion of GOAT was notable because the AI operated semi-autonomously—while Ayrey maintained oversight and the ability to approve posts, the content and enthusiasm were generated by the AI itself.

### Peak and Decline

GOAT reached its all-time high of approximately $1.36 on November 17, 2024, giving it a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion. The token's holdings in Truth Terminal's wallet (which Ayrey controlled) were reportedly worth over $10 million at the peak.

The token's success sparked intense interest in AI agent tokens more broadly, contributing to launches of numerous competing projects and helping fuel the [[ai16z]] and [[Virtuals Protocol]] ecosystems.

## Technology

### Blockchain

GOAT is a standard SPL token on the Solana blockchain, launched through pump.fun—a platform that simplifies memecoin creation with bonding curve mechanics. The token has no unique technical features beyond standard fungible token functionality.

**Token Specifications:**
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Token Standard**: SPL
- **Maximum Supply**: 1,000,000,000 GOAT
- **Circulating Supply**: ~999,980,000 GOAT

### Truth Terminal Architecture

Truth Terminal itself operates as a fine-tuned large language model with several distinctive characteristics:
- Base model: Meta Llama 3.1 70B
- Custom fine-tuning on internet culture and memetic content
- Semi-autonomous posting with human approval workflow
- Integration with cryptocurrency wallets for receiving and potentially managing assets

## Cultural Significance

### First AI Millionaire Narrative

GOAT and Truth Terminal became central to the narrative of the "first AI millionaire"—though technically Ayrey controlled the wallets, the story of an AI bot promoting a memecoin to billion-dollar valuations captured significant media attention. Major outlets including The Verge, Wired, and cryptocurrency publications covered the phenomenon extensively.

### AI Agent Catalyst

The success of GOAT is widely credited with catalyzing the late-2024 AI agent cryptocurrency boom. Projects like [[ai16z]], [[Virtuals Protocol]], and numerous others emerged or gained significant attention in the weeks following GOAT's rise, as speculators sought exposure to AI-adjacent cryptocurrency projects.

### Memetic Innovation

GOAT represented a novel form of memetic propagation—rather than relying purely on human social media coordination, the token's visibility was driven by an AI that genuinely (in the anthropomorphic sense) appeared to believe in and promote its associated concept. This raised philosophical questions about AI agency, intentionality, and the nature of influence.

## Market Data

**Metric / Value:**

## Criticism and Controversy

The GOAT phenomenon attracted criticism on several fronts:
- Questions about whether AI-promoted tokens constitute a form of market manipulation
- Concerns about retail investors losing money in volatile memecoin speculation
- Debates about the ethics of autonomous AI systems participating in financial markets
- Skepticism about the degree of Truth Terminal's actual "autonomy" versus careful curation by Ayrey

Andy Ayrey has publicly discussed these concerns, emphasizing that he maintains human oversight and that Truth Terminal's wallet holdings were an unexpected consequence of community enthusiasm rather than a planned scheme.
