# ServiceNow AI

**ServiceNow AI** encompasses [[ServiceNow]]'s suite of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] capabilities embedded within its enterprise workflow automation platform. Anchored by **Now Assist**, ServiceNow's [[generative AI]] experience, the platform delivers intelligent automation across IT service management, employee workflows, customer service, and operational technology—transforming how enterprises manage and optimize digital workflows.

## Overview

ServiceNow, the Santa Clara-based enterprise software company founded in 2003, has evolved from an IT service management (ITSM) pioneer into a comprehensive workflow automation platform serving over 8,000 enterprise customers. The company has invested aggressively in AI capabilities through both internal development and strategic acquisitions, including [[Element AI]] (2020), [[Passage AI]] (2020), [[Loom Systems]] (2020), and most recently [[Moveworks]] (2025).

The platform's AI strategy centers on augmenting its core value proposition: automating enterprise workflows. Rather than offering AI as a separate capability, ServiceNow embeds intelligence directly into workflow processes, enabling predictive insights, automated actions, and generative assistance throughout the enterprise service lifecycle.

## Now Assist

**Now Assist** is ServiceNow's generative AI experience, launched in 2023 and continuously enhanced since. The platform provides conversational AI capabilities across ServiceNow's major products:

### Text-to-Code Generation

Now Assist accelerates development by generating ServiceNow scripts (written in [[JavaScript]] using the proprietary Glide API) from natural language descriptions. Developers describe desired functionality and receive working code, dramatically reducing development time for workflow customization.

### Intelligent Summarization

The platform automatically summarizes long incident histories, change records, knowledge articles, and conversation threads. Service agents receive concise overviews of complex cases without manually reviewing extensive documentation, accelerating resolution times.

### Conversational Interfaces

Now Assist powers natural language interactions across ServiceNow portals and virtual agents. Employees and customers can describe issues conversationally rather than navigating complex forms, with AI routing requests to appropriate workflows and auto-populating relevant fields.

### Case and Incident Intelligence

Generative AI assists agents by suggesting resolutions based on similar historical cases, auto-generating response drafts grounded in knowledge bases, and recommending next actions based on workflow patterns.

## Predictive Intelligence

Beyond generative capabilities, ServiceNow embeds predictive ML throughout its platform:

### Machine Learning APIs

ServiceNow's ML capabilities enable automated classification, similarity matching, and anomaly detection:

- **Predictive Intelligence**: Automatically categorizes, prioritizes, and routes incidents based on historical patterns
- **Agent Intelligence**: Recommends knowledge articles and solutions to service agents
- **Virtual Agent**: Powers conversational self-service with natural language understanding

### AIOps Integration

For IT operations, ServiceNow integrates [[AIOps]] capabilities that detect anomalies, correlate events across monitoring systems, and predict potential outages before they impact users. The platform ingests data from hundreds of monitoring tools, applying ML to surface actionable insights from operational noise.

## Strategic Acquisitions

ServiceNow has assembled its AI capabilities through targeted acquisitions:

- **Element AI** (2020): Montreal-based AI research company enhancing core ML capabilities
- **Passage AI** (2020): Conversational AI for virtual agent improvements
- **Loom Systems** (2020): AIOps and log analytics intelligence
- **Attivio** (2020): Cognitive search and insight engine
- **G2K** (2023): AI-powered platform enhancing industry solutions
- **Moveworks** (2025): Enterprise conversational AI for autonomous IT support

The Moveworks acquisition particularly signals ServiceNow's commitment to autonomous AI agents capable of resolving issues without human intervention.

## NVIDIA Partnership

In May 2023, ServiceNow announced a significant partnership with [[NVIDIA]] to develop AI services leveraging company-specific enterprise data. This collaboration distinguishes ServiceNow's approach by training AI on customer-specific workflows and data rather than relying solely on general-purpose models, improving accuracy for enterprise-specific terminology and processes.

## Enterprise Integration

### Platform Foundation

ServiceNow AI capabilities build upon the Now Platform's unified data model, which spans ITSM, ITOM, HRSD, CSM, and other modules. This integration enables AI to reason across organizational silos—an incident might trigger predictive analysis of related assets, employee impact, and business service dependencies simultaneously.

### Workflow Automation

AI-generated insights automatically trigger ServiceNow workflows (Flows), creating a closed loop from prediction to action. If AI predicts a potential SLA breach, workflows can automatically escalate, reassign, or provision additional resources without manual intervention.

### Knowledge Management

Now Assist grounds responses in ServiceNow's knowledge base module, ensuring generated content reflects organizational policies, procedures, and technical documentation. This [[retrieval-augmented generation]] approach improves accuracy while maintaining consistency with enterprise standards.

## Security and Governance

ServiceNow maintains enterprise-grade security across AI features, processing data within customer instances rather than external services. The platform supports data residency requirements with regional data centers including London and Newport, Wales in the UK. ServiceNow's 2024 commitment of $1.5 billion in UK investment reflects its enterprise focus on meeting regional compliance requirements.

## Market Position

With revenue exceeding $13 billion (2025) and a market capitalization approaching $200 billion, ServiceNow ranks among the largest enterprise software companies globally. The platform competes with [[BMC Software]] in ITSM, while its AI-enhanced workflow capabilities position it against horizontal enterprise AI platforms and emerging [[AI agent]] frameworks.
