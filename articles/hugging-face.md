# Hugging Face

**Hugging Face, Inc.** is an American [[machine learning]] platform company headquartered in [[New York City]], known for its open-source [[transformers]] library and hosting the world's largest repository of machine learning models and datasets. Founded in 2016, the company has become the de facto hub for the AI research community, hosting over one million model checkpoints and enabling collaboration across the global ML ecosystem.

## Overview

Hugging Face operates as a collaboration platform for machine learning, providing infrastructure for researchers and developers to share models, datasets, and applications. The company develops open-source tools that have become industry standards, including the Transformers library for PyTorch and TensorFlow, and hosts the Hugging Face Hub where users can discover, share, and deploy machine learning models.

## History

The company was founded in 2016 by French entrepreneurs Clément Delangue, Julien Chaumond, and Thomas Wolf. Originally launched as a chatbot application targeted at teenagers (the company is named after the 🤗 hugging face emoji), Hugging Face pivoted to become a machine learning platform after open-sourcing the model behind their chatbot.

In April 2021, Hugging Face launched the BigScience Research Workshop, a collaborative effort to create an open large language model. This initiative concluded in 2022 with the release of [[BLOOM]], a 176-billion parameter multilingual model.

In February 2023, Hugging Face announced a partnership with [[Amazon Web Services]], making its products available to AWS customers and committing to run next-generation models on AWS's Trainium chips.

In June 2024, the company launched an AI accelerator program for European startups in partnership with [[Meta Platforms|Meta]] and Scaleway, based at STATION F in Paris.

In September 2024, Hugging Face partnered with Meta and [[UNESCO]] to launch a free online translator supporting 200 languages, built on Meta's No Language Left Behind model.

In April 2025, Hugging Face acquired Pollen Robotics, a French humanoid robotics startup, signaling expansion into open-source robotics.

## Technology and Products

### Hugging Face Hub

The Hub serves as GitHub for machine learning, hosting:
- Over 1 million model checkpoints
- Thousands of datasets across all modalities
- Spaces for hosting ML demos and applications
- Inference API for model deployment

### Enterprise Services

- **Team & Enterprise**: Advanced platform with enterprise security and access controls
- **Inference Providers**: Unified API access to 45,000+ models from leading providers
- **Text Generation Inference (TGI)**: Optimized serving for language models

## Current State (Early 2026)

Hugging Face continues to be the central platform for the open-source AI community. The company employs approximately 250 people as of 2025, following a small layoff of 4% of staff in February 2025.

The acquisition of Pollen Robotics reflects CEO Clément Delangue's vision to "make Artificial Intelligence robotics Open Source," extending Hugging Face's mission beyond software into physical AI systems.

The Transformers library remains the dominant framework for model implementation, serving as the pivot point between training frameworks (Axolotl, Unsloth, DeepSpeed, FSDP), inference engines (vLLM, SGLang, TGI), and adjacent tools (llama.cpp, MLX).
