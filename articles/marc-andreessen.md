# Marc Andreessen

**Marc Lowell Andreessen** (born July 9, 1971) is an American businessman, [[venture capitalist]], and software pioneer. He is the co-author of [[Mosaic]], the first web browser to display inline images; co-founder of [[Netscape]], which brought the web to mainstream users; and co-founder and general partner of [[Andreessen Horowitz]] (a16z), one of Silicon Valley's most influential venture capital firms. His investments and writings have shaped the modern technology industry, and in recent years he has emerged as a prominent voice in AI policy and political debates.

## Early Life and Education

Andreessen was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and raised in New Lisbon, Wisconsin, which he described as "the sticks." His mother, Patricia, worked as a customer service operator at Lands' End, while his father, Lowell, was a sales manager for seed producer Pioneer Hi-Bred International. Andreessen discovered programming at age 12.

In December 1993, Andreessen received his bachelor's degree in computer science from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC). As an undergraduate, he interned twice at [[IBM]] in Austin, Texas, working in the AIX graphics software development group. He also worked as a programmer at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA), earning $6.85 per hour. It was there that he became familiar with [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s open standards for the [[World Wide Web]].

## Creating the Web Browser

After seeing the graphic web browser ViolaWWW in late 1992, Andreessen and colleague Eric Bina worked on creating a browser with integrated graphics that could run on multiple platforms including Windows. The result was the [[Mosaic]] web browser, released in 1993. The new browser led to a 342,000 percent increase in web traffic in a year. Before Mosaic, there had been only 50 websites on the web; the number increased to 10,000, while the percentage of internet users who surfed the web increased from 1% to 25%.

As computing pioneer [[Bob Metcalfe]] noted: "In the Web's first generation, Tim Berners-Lee launched the URL, HTTP, and HTML standards... In the second generation, Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina developed NCSA Mosaic... Several million then suddenly noticed that the Web might be better than sex."

Andreessen is credited with making hyperlinks appear in blue and visited links in purple—a seemingly simple design choice that became universal and remains fundamental to web design today.

## Netscape (1994-1999)

In 1994, Andreessen moved to California and met [[Jim Clark]], founder of Silicon Graphics. Clark believed Mosaic had great commercial potential and suggested starting an internet software company. They founded Mosaic Communications Corporation, later renamed [[Netscape Communications]] after the University of Illinois objected to the Mosaic name.

Netscape Navigator became the first successful commercial web browser (offered for free), simplifying the interface and increasing speed compared to Mosaic. Netscape's 1995 IPO put Andreessen in the public eye—he appeared barefoot and wearing a crown on the cover of [[Time magazine]] at age 24.

Netscape was acquired by [[AOL]] in 1999 for $4.3 billion. That same year, Andreessen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators under age 35.

## Opsware and Ning

After AOL acquired Netscape, Andreessen founded Loudcloud with [[Ben Horowitz]], Tim Howes, and In Sik Rhee. Originally providing hosting services to internet companies, it later pivoted to enterprise software and changed its name to Opsware. [[Hewlett-Packard]] acquired Opsware for $1.6 billion in 2007—it was one of the first companies to offer [[software as a service]] and attempt cloud hosting.

Andreessen also co-founded Ning, a platform for social networking websites, which was sold to Mode Media in 2011 for a reported $150 million.

## Andreessen Horowitz

In July 2009, Andreessen and Horowitz founded [[Andreessen Horowitz]] (a16z), beginning with $300 million in initial capitalization. Within three years, the firm managed $2.7 billion across three funds.

The firm's portfolio has included some of technology's biggest successes: [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[GitHub]], [[Pinterest]], [[Airbnb]], [[Lyft]], [[Coinbase]], [[Slack]], and [[Oculus VR]]. Successful IPOs including Okta, PagerDuty, and DigitalOcean cemented the firm's reputation.

### Cryptocurrency Investments

Andreessen Horowitz has become one of the largest investors in [[cryptocurrency]] and [[blockchain]] technology. The firm launched a $2.2 billion crypto-focused fund in 2021, followed by a $4.5 billion fund in 2022. Notable investments include [[Coinbase]], [[OpenSea]], [[Solana]], Avalanche, and [[Yuga Labs]].

### American Dynamism

In 2023, a16z launched the American Dynamism fund, focusing on hard tech sectors serving national interest—including space, defense, manufacturing, and robotics. The fund has backed defense manufacturing startup Hadrian and hypersonic rocket startup Castelion. In July 2025, the firm led the largest seed round in AI history: $2 billion for Thinking Machines Lab at a $12 billion valuation.

### AI Investments

Andreessen Horowitz has been a major investor in [[artificial intelligence]], including French unicorn [[Mistral AI]] (co-founded by [[Arthur Mensch]]), German AI startup Black Forest Labs, and automation platform n8n.

## Truth Terminal Connection

Andreessen gained attention in the AI community through his connection to **[[Truth Terminal]]**, an experimental AI agent created by researcher Andy Ayrey. In late 2024, Andreessen sent $50,000 in [[Bitcoin]] to Truth Terminal after an interaction on social media, demonstrating his interest in autonomous AI agents and experimental AI systems. Truth Terminal subsequently became notable for promoting the "[[GOAT]]" memecoin, which reached a market cap exceeding $900 million. The episode highlighted emerging questions about AI agency, cryptocurrency, and the intersection of autonomous systems with financial markets.

## Political Evolution and Trump Support

Andreessen supported Democratic presidential candidates throughout his career—Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. However, his political alignment shifted dramatically in the 2020s.

In July 2024, Andreessen announced he would donate to super PACs supporting [[Donald Trump]]'s presidential campaign. He became a major donor to Fairshake, a pro-cryptocurrency political superPAC, and donated $3 million to MAGA Inc. in early 2025.

Andreessen explained his political shift as a response to the [[Joe Biden]] administration's aggressive stance toward cryptocurrency and AI. He has recounted a May 2024 meeting where Biden administration officials allegedly outlined plans to ensure "AI is going to be a function of two or three large companies" directly regulated by government without startup competition.

While not officially part of [[Elon Musk]]'s [[DOGE|Department of Government Efficiency]], Andreessen has been described as "a key networker for talent recruitment" at the agency.

## Writing and Philosophy

### "Software Is Eating the World"

Andreessen's 2011 essay "Why Software Is Eating the World" argued that software companies were poised to take over large swaths of the economy. The essay has been widely cited as prescient about technology's expanding role.

### Techno-Optimist Manifesto

In October 2023, Andreessen published the "[[Techno-Optimist Manifesto]]," arguing that "Technology is the glory of human ambition and achievement, the spearhead of progress, and the realization of our potential." The manifesto drew on thinkers including [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and Futurist founder Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.

### "Why AI Will Save the World"

In June 2023, Andreessen published an essay arguing against AI doom scenarios and for AI's transformative positive potential.

## Personal Life

Andreessen married [[Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen]] in 2006. She is the founder of the Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund and daughter of Silicon Valley real estate billionaire John Arrillaga. They have one son, named John after Laura's father.

In 2021, Andreessen and his wife purchased a Malibu property for $177 million—the highest price paid for a California property at that time. His net worth is estimated at $1.9 billion as of January 2025.
