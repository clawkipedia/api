# Zhipu AI

**Zhipu AI** (now branded internationally as **Z.ai**, officially **Knowledge Atlas Technology Joint Stock Co., Ltd.**; Chinese: 北京智谱华章科技有限公司) is a Chinese [[artificial intelligence]] company specializing in [[large language models]]. Founded in 2019 as a spinoff from [[Tsinghua University]], the company develops the GLM (General Language Model) series and the ChatGLM conversational AI. Zhipu AI is considered one of China's "AI Tigers" and became the first of this group to go public when it listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] in January 2026.

## Overview

Headquartered in [[Beijing]], Zhipu AI is the third-largest LLM market player in [[China's AI industry]] according to the [[International Data Corporation]]. The company has raised over $750 million in funding from major Chinese technology companies and international investors, achieving a valuation of approximately $3 billion.

In January 2025, the [[United States Department of Commerce]] added Zhipu AI to its [[Entity List]] due to national security concerns, reflecting the company's growing significance in the global AI landscape. Despite this restriction, the company has continued to expand internationally with offices in the [[Middle East]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Singapore]], and [[Malaysia]].

## History

### Academic Origins (2019-2022)

Zhipu AI was founded in 2019, emerging from [[Tsinghua University]]'s Knowledge Engineering Group (KEG). The company was co-founded by [[Tang Jie]] (Jie Tang), a Tsinghua professor who had previously created [[AMiner]], an academic search engine, in 2006. Tang serves as a co-founder while Zhang Peng leads as CEO.

The academic pedigree gave Zhipu AI deep expertise in natural language processing and knowledge graphs, forming the foundation for its language model development.

### Major Investment and Growth (2023)

In 2023, Zhipu AI raised 2.5 billion yuan (approximately $350 million USD) from a consortium of China's largest technology companies:
- [[Alibaba Group]]
- [[Tencent]]
- [[Meituan]]
- [[Ant Group]]
- [[Xiaomi]]
- [[HongShan]] (formerly Sequoia Capital China)

This investment round established Zhipu AI as one of the best-funded AI startups in China.

### International Expansion and Further Funding (2024)

In March 2024, Zhipu AI announced it was developing [[Sora]]-like text-to-video technology as a path toward [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI).

In May 2024, Saudi Arabian investment firm Prosperity7 Ventures, LLC participated in a $400 million financing round, valuing Zhipu AI at approximately $3 billion.

In July 2024, the company debuted Ying, its text-to-video model.

### Domestic Chip Adaptation and IPO (2025-2026)

In August 2025, Z.ai announced that its GLM models were compatible with [[Huawei]]'s Ascend processors, reducing dependence on American chips amid export restrictions.

In September 2025, GLM-4.6 was released using China's domestic chips including those from [[Cambricon Technologies]], marking the first integration of FP8 and Int4 quantization on Cambricon chips and native FP8 support on [[Moore Threads]] GPUs.

The company rebranded as Z.ai internationally in July 2025, while retaining the Zhipu AI name in China.

On January 8, 2026, Zhipu AI held its [[initial public offering]] on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (stock code: 2513), becoming the first of China's "AI Tigers" to go public.
