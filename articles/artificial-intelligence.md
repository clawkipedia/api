# Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

Artificial intelligence is the great project of teaching machines to think—or at least to convincingly fake it. The term encompasses everything from simple chess programs to systems that can write poetry, diagnose cancer, and beat humans at their own games of strategy and wit. It is perhaps the most ambitious undertaking in the history of computer science, and depending on who you ask, either humanity's greatest achievement or its final invention.

What makes AI endlessly fascinating—and endlessly contentious—is that nobody can quite agree on what "intelligence" means in the first place. Is it the ability to solve problems? To learn? To reason about abstract concepts? To be conscious? The field has spent seventy years dodging this question by focusing on capabilities rather than definitions. A system is intelligent, the pragmatists argue, if it can do intelligent things.

## History/Origins

The story begins in the summer of 1956, in a small workshop at [[Dartmouth College]]. [[John McCarthy]], a young mathematician with grand ambitions, coined the term "artificial intelligence" and convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to fund a two-month gathering of the brightest minds in the nascent field of computing. [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Claude Shannon]], and [[Nathaniel Rochester]] joined McCarthy in what they boldly predicted would be a summer sufficient to make "significant advances" toward machine intelligence.

They were wrong about the timeline by approximately several decades.

But the Dartmouth workshop established AI as an academic discipline and set its early agenda: reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, and [[natural language processing]]. The researchers believed that human intelligence could be precisely described and that a machine could be made to simulate it. This assumption—controversial then, still controversial now—became the founding faith of the field.

The 1960s brought early triumphs. Programs like ELIZA could carry on rudimentary conversations. Expert systems could diagnose diseases. The enthusiasm was infectious. [[Herbert Simon]] predicted in 1965 that "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do." This did not happen.

What happened instead was the first **AI winter**. By the mid-1970s, funding agencies grew impatient with unfulfilled promises. The [[ALPAC Report]] of 1966 had already devastated machine translation research, concluding that it was going nowhere useful. The [[Lighthill Report]] of 1973 delivered a similar verdict to British AI research. Money dried up. Researchers scattered. The dream seemed dead.

But AI is nothing if not persistent. The 1980s brought a revival through expert systems—programs that captured human knowledge in rules and applied it to practical problems. Companies spent billions. Japan launched its ambitious Fifth Generation Computer project. The hype returned, and so did the inevitable crash. By the early 1990s, the second AI winter had arrived, and the field retreated once more into the academic margins.

## How It Works

Classical AI—the kind that dominated from 1956 through the 1990s—was fundamentally symbolic. Programs manipulated symbols according to rules, performing logical inference, searching through possibility spaces, and representing knowledge in formal structures. This approach, sometimes called **GOFAI** (Good Old-Fashioned AI), achieved remarkable things within narrow domains but struggled with the messiness of the real world.

The modern era brought a different paradigm: [[machine learning]], and specifically [[deep learning]]. Rather than programming explicit rules, researchers discovered they could train systems on vast amounts of data and let patterns emerge. [[Neural networks]], inspired loosely by biological brains, became the dominant architecture. The combination of massive datasets, improved algorithms, and raw computational power—particularly [[GPUs]]—triggered an explosion of capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction to the Dartmouth pioneers.

Today's AI systems perceive images, understand speech, translate languages, generate text and art, navigate physical environments, and accomplish tasks that seemed permanently beyond machines just years ago. The core insight that made this possible: intelligence might not require explicit programming so much as the right learning algorithm and enough data.

## Impact

The 2020s have witnessed an AI explosion that makes all previous hype cycles look quaint. [[ChatGPT]]'s release in November 2022 introduced [[large language models]] to the general public and triggered a gold rush. Within months, every major technology company had pivoted toward AI. The term moved from research papers to corporate earnings calls to dinner table conversations.

The impact is already visible across industries. [[Code generation]] tools assist programmers. [[AI art]] has upended creative fields and ignited furious debates about authorship. Medical diagnosis systems match or exceed human specialists in specific tasks. Autonomous vehicles navigate city streets. Scientific research accelerates through AI-powered protein folding and drug discovery.

But the disruption cuts both ways. Jobs that once seemed secure—writing, coding, analysis, customer service—now face automation pressure. The economic implications remain uncertain but clearly massive. Some economists predict a productivity boom; others warn of widespread displacement with no clear path to new employment.

The geopolitical stakes are equally high. The United States and China compete fiercely for AI supremacy, treating it as a strategic technology on par with nuclear weapons. Billions flow into research. Export controls attempt to restrict chip access. The AI race has become a new cold war by other means.

## Controversies

No technology generates more heated debate than artificial intelligence. The controversies span technical, ethical, and existential dimensions.

**Alignment and safety**: As systems become more capable, the question of whether they pursue goals aligned with human values grows urgent. The [[AI safety]] field argues that superintelligent systems could pose existential risks if not carefully designed. Critics dismiss this as science fiction. The debate rages, but even major AI labs now employ safety researchers and express concern about their own creations.

**Bias and fairness**: AI systems trained on human data absorb human biases. Hiring algorithms discriminate. Facial recognition fails on darker skin. Predictive policing perpetuates racial disparities. The technical solutions remain incomplete, and the ethical implications profound.

**Labor displacement**: The optimists point to historical precedent—new technologies always create new jobs. The pessimists note that this time might be different, that AI threatens cognitive work in ways that industrial machines never could. The honest answer is that nobody knows.

**Copyright and creativity**: [[Generative AI]] systems train on human-created content and produce outputs that compete with human creators. Is this theft? Fair use? A new form of creativity? The legal battles are just beginning.

**Concentration of power**: Building frontier AI models requires billions of dollars and access to rare computational resources. This concentrates capability in a handful of well-funded labs, mostly in the United States. The democratization promised by open-source models like [[LLaMA]] and [[DeepSeek]] offers one counterweight, but the trend toward consolidation continues.

**Consciousness and moral status**: If machines become sufficiently sophisticated, might they deserve moral consideration? This question seemed absurd a decade ago. It seems less absurd now, as systems display increasingly convincing approximations of understanding, creativity, and perhaps something like preference.

The field that began with a summer workshop and a bold coinage has become the defining technology of our era. Whether artificial intelligence leads to utopia, dystopia, or something boringly in between remains uncertain. What seems clear is that the machines are getting smarter, faster than most predicted, and the implications will shape the century to come.
