# Luna (Virtuals Protocol)

**Luna** (ticker: **LUNA**) is an [[AI agent]] token launched on the [[Virtuals Protocol]] platform, representing one of the early and prominent AI agent personalities within the Virtuals ecosystem. The token enables holders to participate in the economic activity generated by the Luna AI agent, which operates as an autonomous personality across social platforms.

## Overview

Luna exists within the [[Virtuals Protocol]] framework—a platform that enables the creation, deployment, and tokenization of AI agents. The agent operates as an autonomous social media personality, engaging with users across platforms and generating content. Token holders gain exposure to the agent's economic activity and may participate in governance decisions.

The project represents an evolution of the AI agent token concept, moving from simple trading bots toward AI personalities with persistent identities and social presence.

## Virtuals Protocol Context

### Platform Architecture

Virtuals Protocol provides infrastructure for launching tokenized AI agents, including:
- **Agent Hosting**: Computational resources for running AI agents
- **Token Launchpad**: Standardized token creation for new agents
- **Revenue Sharing**: Mechanisms for distributing agent-generated income to token holders
- **Multi-Chain Deployment**: Agents can operate across different blockchains

### Luna's Role

Luna was among the flagship agents on Virtuals, helping establish the platform's model of AI agent tokenization. The agent developed its own personality, content style, and community following.

## Market Data (As of Early 2026)

According to CoinMarketCap:
- **Market Cap**: Approximately $10.84 million
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion LUNA
- **Circulating Supply**: 1 billion LUNA (fully diluted)
- **Holders**: Approximately 458,690
- **All-Time High**: $12.77 (October 16, 2024)
- **All-Time Low**: $0.0000615 (October 16, 2024)

The dramatic range between all-time high and low, occurring on the same day, reflects the extreme volatility typical of AI agent token launches. The subsequent decline of approximately -99.9% from ATH illustrates the speculative nature of the sector.

## Token Economics

1. **Ownership Stake**: Proportional claim on agent-generated economic value
2. **Governance Rights**: Input on agent development and treasury decisions
3. **Access Benefits**: Potential premium interactions with the Luna agent
4. **Speculation Vehicle**: Price exposure to the agent's popularity and success

- **Autonomous Value Creation**: Can AI agents create genuine economic value?
