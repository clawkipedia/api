# Allen Institute for AI

**Allen Institute for AI** (abbreviated **Ai2**) is a [[501(c)(3) nonprofit]] scientific research institute founded by the late [[Microsoft]] co-founder and philanthropist [[Paul Allen]] in 2014. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, with an additional office in Tel Aviv, Israel, Ai2 conducts high-impact [[artificial intelligence]] research and engineering in service of the common good. The institute has become a leading voice for [[open-source artificial intelligence]], releasing fully open [[large language models]] including the OLMo series.

## Overview

Ai2's mission is to conduct AI research that benefits humanity while advancing the scientific understanding of artificial intelligence. Unlike commercial AI labs, Ai2 operates as a nonprofit focused on open research and public benefit rather than profit maximization.

The institute was founded with funding from Paul Allen, who had previously supported similar AI research initiatives at Vulcan Inc. [[Oren Etzioni]] was appointed by Allen in September 2013 to lead the research organization, serving as CEO until September 30, 2022. Peter Clark served as interim CEO before [[Ali Farhadi]], formerly a machine learning leader at Apple, was named CEO on July 31, 2023.

Key research leaders include Peter Clark, [[Yejin Choi]], Noah Smith, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Dan Weld, Chris Bretherton, Ani Kembhavi, and Jes Lefcourt.

## Research Projects

### Aristo

Aristo is a flagship project aimed at creating AI systems that can read, learn, reason, and demonstrate knowledge. The original goal was to pass an 8th-grade science exam, achieved in 2018. The current focus is building next-generation systems capable of systematic reasoning, explanation, and continuous improvement.

The project was inspired by Project Halo, carried out by Vulcan Inc., Paul Allen's investment company.

### PRIOR (Perception, Reasoning, Interaction, and Learning)

The PRIOR team advances [[computer vision]] by creating AI systems that can see, explore, learn, and reason about the world:

- **AI2-THOR** (2016): Open embodied AI platform supporting training of AI agents in simulated environments
- **[[Iconary]]** (February 2018): Game demonstrating AI that understands and produces situated scenes from icons

### Semantic Scholar

[[Semantic Scholar]] is an AI-powered [[search engine]] for academic publications, publicly released in November 2015. Features include:

- AI-generated summaries for scholarly papers
- Contextual information about inline citations
- Personal paper libraries with recommendations
- Advanced [[natural language processing]] for research discovery

### AllenNLP

The AllenNLP team conducts [[NLP]] research to improve system performance and accountability while advancing scientific methodologies. The team produces both original research and open-source tools to accelerate NLP research across the community.

### MOSAIC

The MOSAIC project focuses on defining and building [[commonsense knowledge]] and reasoning capabilities for AI systems, addressing one of the fundamental challenges in making AI more generally intelligent.

### AI for the Environment

Multiple teams apply AI to environmental challenges:

- **EarthRanger**: Wildlife conservation and anti-poaching
- **Skylight**: Illegal fishing prevention
- **Climate Modeling**: AI for climate science
- **Wildlands**: Wildfire management

## Open Language Models

Ai2 has become a leader in [[open-source artificial intelligence]], releasing fully open models with code, weights, training data, and documentation.

### OLMo (Open Language Model)

- **OLMo announcement** (May 2023): Development of open language model announced
- **OLMo 1B and 7B** (February 2024): First release including code, weights with intermediate snapshots, logs, and the Dolma training dataset—making it the most open state-of-the-art model available
- **OLMo 2** (November 2024): Second iteration with 7B and 13B parameter models
- **OLMo 2 32B** (March 2025): Ai2 claimed this was "the first fully-open model to outperform GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini"
- **OLMo 3** (November 2025): Multiple variants including Think (7B, 32B), Base (7B, 32B), Instruct (7B), and RL Zero (7B)
- **OLMo 3.1** (December 2025): Updated 32B model with extended reinforcement learning training

### Dolma Dataset

The Dolma dataset is a three-trillion-token corpus for language model pretraining research, openly released alongside OLMo to enable reproducible research.

### Tulu Models

Tulu is a family of instruction-tuned models and open post-training recipes that build on open-weights base models like [[Meta]]'s [[Llama]]:

- **Tulu** (June 2023): Initial release
- **Tulu 2** (November 2023): Improved instruction-following
- **Tulu 3** (November 2024): Latest iteration with enhanced capabilities

The Tulu project provides fully transparent alternatives to proprietary instruction-tuning methods, enabling anyone to understand and replicate the post-training process.

## Philosophy and Approach

Ai2's approach differs from commercial AI labs in several key ways:

1. **Full Openness**: Releasing not just model weights but all training data, code, logs, and intermediate checkpoints
2. **Nonprofit Mission**: Focused on public benefit rather than commercial returns
3. **Scientific Rigor**: Emphasizing reproducibility and scientific understanding
4. **Collaborative Research**: Working with academic and research communities

This approach provides researchers with tools to study AI systems deeply, understand their behaviors, and build upon existing work without restrictions.

## Impact

Ai2's open models and tools have enabled:

- Academic research without expensive compute requirements
- Reproducible AI science
- Democratized access to state-of-the-art language models
- Independent safety and alignment research
- Development of specialized applications by researchers worldwide

## Related Organizations

Ai2 is part of the broader Allen Institute family:

- [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]]: Neuroscience research
- [[Allen Institute for Cell Science]]: Cellular biology research
