# Tesla Optimus

**Optimus**, also known as **Tesla Bot**, is a general-purpose [[humanoid-robot|humanoid robot]] under development by [[tesla|Tesla, Inc.]] First announced in August 2021, Optimus represents Tesla's ambitious entry into the robotics industry, leveraging the company's expertise in [[artificial-intelligence|artificial intelligence]], [[computer-vision|computer vision]], and manufacturing at scale.

## Overview

Tesla CEO [[elon-musk|Elon Musk]] has described Optimus as potentially "more significant than [Tesla's] vehicle business over time," reflecting the company's belief that humanoid robots could become a transformative technology rivaling or exceeding the impact of electric vehicles.

The robot is named after [[optimus-prime|Optimus Prime]], the main character from the [[transformers|Transformers]] media franchise, reflecting both its humanoid form and Tesla's characteristically bold branding approach.

## Development Timeline

### 2021: Announcement
Optimus was announced at Tesla's AI Day event on August 19, 2021. The initial presentation featured a human dancer in a robot costume, signaling Tesla's intent rather than demonstrating functional hardware. Tesla proposed that Optimus would be "controlled by the same AI system" used in [[tesla-autopilot|Tesla Autopilot]], enabling transfer of [[neural-network|neural network]] technology between vehicles and robots.

### 2022: First Prototypes
At the Cyber Rodeo event (April 2022) and AI Day 2022 (September 2022), Tesla displayed semi-functional prototypes. The robots demonstrated basic capabilities including walking and arm movement, though these early versions were less capable than competing systems from established robotics companies.

### 2023: Generation 2
December 2023 marked a significant improvement with Optimus Generation 2, featuring:
- Slimmer, more refined design
- Improved hands with 11 [[degrees-of-freedom|degrees of freedom]]
- Enhanced movement capabilities
- Demonstrations of delicate tasks like handling eggs
- Dancing capabilities

### 2024: Factory Testing and Generation 3
Throughout 2024, Tesla tested Optimus units in its own manufacturing facilities. Videos showed robots performing factory tasks including sorting and material handling. Generation 3 hands increased to 22 degrees of freedom, enabling more sophisticated manipulation.

The "We, Robot" event in October 2024 featured Optimus robots interacting with attendees, though critics noted significant use of [[teleoperation]] rather than fully autonomous operation.

### 2025: Scaling Production
In March 2025, Musk announced that an Optimus robot would be sent to [[mars|Mars]] aboard a [[spacex-starship|SpaceX Starship]] rocket in 2026—a dramatic demonstration of confidence in the technology.

June 2025 saw leadership changes as Milan Kovac, who led the Optimus program since 2022, departed. Ashok Elluswamy, head of Tesla's Autopilot teams, assumed leadership, signaling deeper integration between Tesla's automotive AI and robotics efforts.

## Technical Specifications

### Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 5 ft 8 in (173 cm)
- **Weight**: 125 lb (57 kg)
- **Carrying Capacity**: 45 lb (20 kg)

### AI System
Optimus utilizes Tesla's neural network technology developed for [[autonomous-vehicle|autonomous vehicles]], including:
- [[computer-vision|Computer vision]] for environment perception
- [[natural-language-processing|Natural language processing]] for human interaction
- [[path-planning|Path planning]] and navigation
- [[object-recognition|Object recognition]] and manipulation

The shared AI foundation between Tesla's vehicles and robots enables cross-platform learning and development efficiency.

### Hands and Manipulation
Tesla has progressively improved Optimus's dexterous capabilities:
- **Generation 2** (2023): 11 degrees of freedom
- **Generation 3** (2024): 22 degrees of freedom

This evolution reflects the challenge of robotic manipulation and Tesla's iterative development approach.

## Intended Applications

Tesla positions Optimus for tasks that are "dangerous, repetitive, and boring":

### Industrial
- Manufacturing assistance
- Material handling
- Assembly operations
- Quality inspection

### Commercial
- Warehouse operations
- Retail assistance
- Hospitality services

### Domestic
- Household chores
- Elder care assistance
- General home help

Musk has projected a retail price of approximately $20,000-$30,000, potentially making humanoid robots accessible to consumers.

## Reception and Criticism

### Skepticism
Optimus has faced substantial skepticism from robotics experts and media:

- **Overpromising**: Critics note Tesla's history of aggressive timelines that often slip
- **Teleoperation concerns**: Many demonstrations relied on human operators rather than autonomous AI
- **Technical gaps**: Early prototypes lagged behind competitors like [[boston-dynamics|Boston Dynamics]]
- **Feasibility questions**: Experts including [[rodney-brooks|Rodney Brooks]] (co-founder of [[irobot|iRobot]]) have called the vision of general-purpose humanoid assistants "pure fantasy thinking"

### Praise
Supporters highlight:
- **Rapid iteration**: Significant improvements between generations
- **Manufacturing scale**: Tesla's ability to produce at volume
- **AI expertise**: Leverage from Autopilot development
- **Investment**: Substantial resources committed to the program

### Industry Response
Tesla's entry has intensified competition in humanoid robotics, with competitors releasing videos demonstrating autonomous capabilities in response to Tesla's teleoperated demos.

## Production Plans

Tesla's announced production roadmap:
- **2025**: Limited production for internal use (1,000+ units in Tesla facilities)
- **2026**: Potential availability for external companies
- **Long-term**: Mass production for consumer market

## Market Position

Optimus competes in an increasingly crowded humanoid robotics market against:
- [[boston-dynamics|Boston Dynamics]] (Atlas)
- [[figure-ai|Figure AI]] (Figure 03)
- [[1x-technologies|1X Technologies]] (NEO)
- [[sanctuary-ai|Sanctuary AI]] (Phoenix)

Tesla's competitive advantages include manufacturing expertise, AI development capabilities, brand recognition, and capital resources. However, the company lacks the decades of robotics experience possessed by competitors like Boston Dynamics.

## Broader Implications

The Optimus program reflects broader trends in technology:
- Convergence of [[artificial-intelligence|AI]] and [[robotics]]
- Interest from automotive companies in humanoid robots
- Debate over the timeline for practical humanoid deployment
- Questions about [[automation]] and labor markets
