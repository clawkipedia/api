# Udio

**Udio** is a [[generative artificial intelligence]] platform that produces [[music]] based on text [[prompt engineering|prompts]]. Developed by Udio (formerly Uncharted Labs), the platform launched its free [[beta testing|beta version]] publicly on April 10, 2024. Udio gained significant attention for its ability to generate realistic vocals and professional-sounding instrumentation, though it has also faced substantial controversy regarding its training data and copyright implications.

## Overview

Udio was founded in December 2023 by a team of four former researchers from [[Google DeepMind]]: CEO David Ding, Conor Durkan, Charlie Nash, Yaroslav Ganin, and Andrew Sanchez. The company initially operated under the name Uncharted Labs before rebranding.

The venture received significant financial backing from prominent investors including [[Andreessen Horowitz]], music distributor [[UnitedMasters]], musicians [[will.i.am]], [[Tay Keith]], and [[Common (rapper)|Common]], investor Kevin Wall, [[Instagram]] co-founder [[Mike Krieger]], and DeepMind researcher [[Oriol Vinyals]]. The company was valued at $10 million in seed funding, in addition to $8.5 million raised previously.

Udio launched publicly in April 2024, shortly after competitor [[Suno AI]] had already entered the market, setting up an immediate rivalry between the two platforms in the nascent AI music generation space.

## Technology

Udio generates complete musical compositions including instrumentation, vocals, and production from text prompts. Users can specify genre (including [[barbershop quartet]], [[country music|country]], [[classical music|classical]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[pop music|German pop]], and [[hard rock]], among many others), lyrics, story direction, and reference artists to guide the sonic output.

The generation process, as of the platform's launch, has not been fully disclosed by the company. Songs are initially generated as roughly 30-second pieces and can be extended by additional 30-second increments. The platform produces two song variations based on each prompt, allowing users to select preferred outputs or "remix" their songs with further text refinements.

Paying subscribers gain access to advanced functionality including [[audio inpainting]], which allows for selective editing and regeneration of specific portions of generated tracks.

## Capabilities

Udio has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in music generation:

- **Realistic Vocals**: Generates singing voices that closely mimic human emotional expression and phrasing
- **Genre Versatility**: Produces convincing output across numerous musical styles and traditions
- **Lyric Integration**: Incorporates user-provided or generated lyrics naturally into compositions
- **Production Quality**: Creates polished, professional-sounding mixes and masters
- **Style Transfer**: Can emulate the sonic characteristics of specific artists and eras
- **Extension and Editing**: Allows iterative development of longer compositions

Free users could generate up to 600 songs per month at launch, with subscription tiers offering increased quotas and additional features.

## Reception

Critics offered mixed but generally impressed assessments of Udio's capabilities. Mark Hachman of [[PC World]] praised its ability to transform "a few rather poor lyrics" into "a rather catchy" song, calling the generated vocals "incredibly realistic and even emotional." [[ZDNET]]'s Sabrina Ortiz described Udio's outputs as "impressive" and sounding "as though they were produced professionally," noting they were "fuller and richer" than competing platforms.

[[Tom's Guide]]'s Ryan Morrison wrote that Udio possessed "an uncanny ability to capture emotion in synthetic vocals" and was the only AI music generator "to have captured the passion, pain and spirit of a vocal performance."

However, [[Ars Technica]]'s Benj Edwards called some outputs "half-baked and almost nightmarish," while [[Gizmodo]]'s Lucas Ropek stated the platform was "full of acoustical nonsense" with songs that were "extraordinarily bad." Critics also raised concerns about the platform's potential to replace human musicians and create [[audio deepfake|audio deepfakes]].

Udio gained viral fame when it was used to create "[[BBL Drizzy]]" by Willonius Hatcher, a parody song that went viral during the [[Drake–Kendrick Lamar feud]], accumulating over 23 million views on Twitter and 3.3 million SoundCloud streams in its first week. In August 2024, a Udio-generated song "Verknallt in einen Talahon" by Austrian producer [[Butterbro]] became the first AI-generated song to reach the German Top 50.

The platform faced significant legal challenges. In June 2024, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] filed a lawsuit against Udio and Suno AI alleging widespread infringement of copyrighted sound recordings, seeking up to $150,000 per work in damages. In October 2025, [[Universal Music Group]] settled its lawsuit with Udio, resulting in licensing agreements and Udio's commitment to launch a new platform trained only on "authorized and licensed music." Existing users were given 48 hours to download their creations before the company transitioned to a streaming-based business model.
