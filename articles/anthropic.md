# Anthropic

**Anthropic PBC** is an American [[artificial intelligence]] company headquartered in San Francisco, California. Founded in 2021 by former [[OpenAI]] employees, Anthropic has developed the [[Claude]] family of [[large language models]] and is recognized as a leader in [[AI safety]] research. The company researches and develops AI to "study their safety properties at the technological frontier" and deploy safe models for public use.

## Overview

Anthropic was founded by siblings [[Dario Amodei]] (CEO) and [[Daniela Amodei]] (President), along with other former OpenAI researchers including [[Jared Kaplan]], Jack Clark, and Ben Mann. The company is structured as a Delaware [[public benefit corporation]], which enables directors to balance stockholders' financial interests with its public benefit purpose.

As of early 2026, Anthropic employs approximately 2,500 people and has achieved a valuation of $350 billion following multiple major funding rounds. The company's "Long-Term Benefit Trust" holds Class T shares that allow it to elect directors to Anthropic's board, ensuring alignment with its mission of responsible AI development.

## History

### Founding and Early Development (2021-2022)

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by seven former employees of OpenAI, including Dario Amodei, who had served as OpenAI's Vice President of Research. The founders left OpenAI due to directional differences regarding AI development approaches.

In April 2022, Anthropic announced $580 million in funding, including a $500 million investment from [[FTX]] under [[Sam Bankman-Fried]]. The company finished training the first version of Claude in summer 2022 but did not immediately release it publicly, citing the need for safety testing and a desire to avoid initiating a race to develop increasingly powerful AI systems.

### Major Investments (2023-2025)

Anthropic has attracted substantial investment from major technology companies:

- **Amazon**: September 2023 partnership with initial $1.25 billion investment, expanded to $4 billion by March 2024, and another $4 billion in November 2024, bringing total investment to $8 billion
- **Google**: October 2023 investment of $500 million with commitment to $1.5 billion over time, plus an additional $1 billion in March 2025
- **Nvidia and Microsoft**: November 2025 partnership with up to $15 billion expected investment; Anthropic committed to purchasing $30 billion in [[Microsoft Azure]] computing capacity

In March 2025, Anthropic raised $3.5 billion in a Series E funding round at a $61.5 billion valuation. This was followed by a $13 billion Series F round in September 2025 at $183 billion valuation, and a $10 billion round in December 2025 at $350 billion valuation.

### Strategic Partnerships

In October 2025, Anthropic announced a cloud partnership with Google providing access to up to one million [[Tensor Processing Units]], expected to bring over one gigawatt of AI compute capacity online by 2026. The company also partnered with [[Databricks]], [[Snowflake]], and acquired [[Bun]] in December 2025 to improve Claude Code's performance.

## Products and Technologies

### Claude Language Models

Anthropic's flagship product line is the Claude series of large language models, named in reference to mathematician [[Claude Shannon]]. The models are trained using [[Constitutional AI]], a technique where the AI adheres to a set of principles called a "constitution."

Model releases include:
- **Claude and Claude Instant** (March 2023)
- **Claude 2** (July 2023, first public release)
- **Claude 3** (March 2024): Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku variants
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (June 2024), updated October 2024
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** (February 2025)
- **Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet** (May 2025)
- **Claude Opus 4.1** (August 2025)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (September 2025)
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** (October 2025)
- **Claude Opus 4.5** (November 2025)

### Developer Tools

- **Claude Code**: A command-line [[AI agent]] for coding, transitioned from research preview to general availability in May 2025 with VS Code and JetBrains IDE integrations
- **Claude Cowork**: A graphical user interface equivalent of Claude Code
- **[[Model Context Protocol]] (MCP)**: An API capability announced at Anthropic's inaugural developer conference in May 2025
- **Web Search API**: Launched May 2025, enabling Claude to access real-time internet information

### Government Applications

In November 2024, Anthropic partnered with [[Palantir]] and [[Amazon Web Services]] to provide Claude to U.S. intelligence and defense agencies. "Claude Gov" was announced in June 2025 for national security applications. In July 2025, Anthropic received a $200 million Department of Defense contract alongside Google, OpenAI, and [[xAI]].

## Research and Safety

Anthropic's core research focuses on [[Constitutional AI]], which trains models to adhere to ethical principles. The company has attracted prominent AI safety researchers, including [[Jan Leike]] and [[John Schulman]] from OpenAI in 2024.

In September 2025, Anthropic announced it would stop selling products to entities majority-owned by Chinese, Russian, Iranian, or North Korean organizations due to national security concerns.

## Controversies

In January 2026, unsealed court filings revealed "Project Panama," Anthropic's confidential operation to destructively scan millions of used books purchased from retailers like [[Better World Books]] to train Claude. Judge William Alsup ruled the destruction of legally purchased books constituted [[fair use]], distinguishing it from prior use of pirated copies.
