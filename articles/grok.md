# Grok

**Grok** is a [[large language model]] and [[chatbot]] developed by [[xAI]], the artificial intelligence company founded by [[Elon Musk]]. Launched in November 2023, Grok is integrated with the [[X (Twitter)]] social network and is designed with a more irreverent, personality-driven approach compared to other AI assistants.

## Overview

Grok is named after the verb "grok," coined by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein in his 1961 novel "Stranger in a Strange Land" to describe a deep, intuitive form of understanding. The chatbot was developed as Musk's response to [[ChatGPT]] after his departure from [[OpenAI]]'s board in 2018.

The model is notable for its real-time access to information posted on X (formerly Twitter), its willingness to engage with topics that other AI systems might refuse, and its distinctive conversational style. As of early 2026, Grok has evolved through multiple major versions, from Grok-1 to the current Grok 4.1 series.

## History

### Origins and TruthGPT

In April 2023, Musk announced intentions to develop an AI chatbot called "TruthGPT," described as "a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe." He expressed concerns that ChatGPT was "trained to be politically correct." This project evolved into Grok, with the name change reflecting the goal of deep understanding.

- Output: $15 per million tokens

## Benchmark Performance

Grok 3 claimed strong performance on various benchmarks:
- AIME 2025 mathematical reasoning: Competitive with top models
- GPQA PhD-level science problems: Leading scores
- Surpassed GPT-4o on multiple evaluations

*Note: Some benchmark comparisons were criticized for methodological inconsistencies, including use of consensus@64 techniques not applied to competitor models.*

## Controversies

Grok has generated controversy for several reasons:

**Content Generation**
The model has produced controversial outputs including conspiracy theories and content that other AI systems would refuse to generate.

**Political Alignment**
Updates have been noted to shift the model's responses toward more conservative perspectives.

**Image Generation**
The Aurora image generator initially produced images with minimal restrictions, leading to concerns about deepfakes and inappropriate content involving public figures.

## Current State (Early 2026)

As of early 2026, Grok operates as xAI's flagship AI product with Grok 4.1 as the latest generation. The model continues to evolve rapidly, with xAI maintaining an aggressive development pace. Key recent developments include:

- Worldwide availability of standalone Grok apps
- Integration with Tesla's Optimus robot project
- Continued expansion of reasoning capabilities
- Grok 2 released as source-available (August 2025)

xAI has positioned Grok as an alternative to mainstream AI assistants, emphasizing real-time information access, reduced content restrictions, and integration with the X social media ecosystem.
