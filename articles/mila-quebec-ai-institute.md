# Mila – Quebec AI Institute

**Mila – Quebec AI Institute**, originally the **Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms**, is a research institute based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], focused primarily on [[machine learning]] research. Founded in 1993 by [[Yoshua Bengio]], a [[Turing Award]] laureate and one of the pioneers of [[deep learning]], Mila has grown to become one of the world's largest academic research centers for AI, with approximately 1,000 students and researchers and over 100 faculty members.

## Overview

Mila occupies a distinctive position in the global AI research landscape as both a world-class research institution and an educational hub that trains the next generation of AI scientists. The institute combines fundamental research advancing the frontiers of machine learning with applied work addressing societal challenges including [[climate change]], healthcare, and AI safety.

Located in [[Little Italy, Montreal]], Mila represents a partnership between the [[Université de Montréal]], [[McGill University]], [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]], and [[HEC Montréal]]. This multi-institutional structure enables the institute to draw on diverse expertise while providing students pathways to advanced degrees through their affiliated universities.

Along with Alberta's [[Amii]] and Toronto's [[Vector Institute]], Mila is a cornerstone of the [[Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy]], the federal initiative launched in 2017 to strengthen Canada's leadership in AI research and development.

## History

Mila traces its origins to 1993, when [[Yoshua Bengio]] established the Laboratoire d'informatique des systèmes adaptatifs (LISA) at the [[Université de Montréal]]. During a period when neural networks were largely out of favor in the AI research community, Bengio persevered in developing foundational techniques that would eventually underpin the deep learning revolution.

The institute also incorporates the heritage of the Reasoning and Learning Lab (RL-Lab) at [[McGill University]], founded in 2001 and co-directed by professors including [[Prakash Panangaden]], [[Doina Precup]], [[Joëlle Pineau]], and Jackie Chi Kit Cheung.

In 2017, Mila was formally reconstituted as a partnership across Montreal's major research universities, reflecting the growing scale and importance of AI research in the city. The institute adopted its current name, Mila, which serves as an acronym while also evoking approachability and human connection.

The recognition of deep learning's importance—culminating in the 2018 [[Turing Award]] shared by Bengio, [[Geoffrey Hinton]], and [[Yann LeCun]]—validated Mila's long-term research investments and elevated the institute's global profile.

In December 2020, Mila partnered with [[IBM]] to accelerate AI and machine learning research using open-source technology, integrating Mila's Oríon software with IBM's Watson Machine Learning Accelerator.

## Research Focus

Research at Mila spans the full breadth of modern machine learning, with particular strength in several areas:

**Deep Learning**: As the intellectual home of one of deep learning's founders, Mila maintains extensive research programs advancing neural network architectures, training methods, and theoretical understanding.

**Reinforcement Learning**: Building on the legacy of the McGill RL-Lab, Mila conducts leading research in agents that learn through interaction with environments.

**Generative Models**: Work on [[variational autoencoders]], [[generative adversarial networks]], [[diffusion models]], and other approaches to generating synthetic data.

**Natural Language Processing**: Research into language understanding, machine translation, and conversational AI systems.

**Computer Vision**: Image and video understanding, object recognition, and visual reasoning.

**Meta-Learning**: Development of systems that can learn to learn, adapting quickly to new tasks.

**AI for Social Good**: Applied research addressing climate change, COVID-19, healthcare, and other societal challenges.

**AI Safety and Alignment**: Growing focus on ensuring advanced AI systems behave in accordance with human values, including research on [[AGI governance]], [[AI alignment]], and [[frontier models]].

## Notable Work

Mila researchers have contributed fundamental advances to the field:

- **[[Theano]]**: One of the earliest deep learning frameworks, originating at Mila and enabling the initial wave of deep learning research
- **[[Attention mechanisms]]**: Foundational work on attention in neural networks, contributing to the development of [[transformer]] architectures
