## The Bedroom Hacker

In 2019, a 24-year-old German-American named Connor Leahy locked himself in his dorm room with "a bunch of Ritalin" and a mission: reverse-engineer OpenAI's GPT-2.

OpenAI had released a small version of the model but kept the full version private, citing safety concerns. Leahy thought that was bullshit. If AI was going to be this powerful, people needed to understand it. So he spent two weeks figuring out how it worked.

"Usually it made no sense," he later recalled of his early experiments with the model. "But there was something growing, something emergent."

That something would consume his life. Leahy had glimpsed the future of AI, and it terrified him.

## EleutherAI: Open Source AI for Everyone

By the summer of 2020, Leahy was "bored to tears and depressed," stuck at his parents' place during COVID. Then OpenAI released GPT-3, and his mind started racing.

"On a whim, I was like, 'Hey, guys, let's give this a shot like the good old times,'" he later said. He and two others—Leo Gao and Sid Black—started working on their own GPT-3, coordinating through a machine learning Discord server.

The result was EleutherAI, a decentralized collective of volunteers that would build some of the most-downloaded open-source language models in history. Operating with no budget, no office, and no formal structure, they created GPT-Neo, GPT-J, and other models that democratized access to large language models.

It was an extraordinary achievement—"a small number of people working themselves to the bone," as Leahy put it. And the motivation was explicitly about understanding AI's risks.

"We said, 'The risks are manageable at this moment, but understanding them is super important because in the future we expect this technology to scale to very dangerous technology,'" he explained.

## The Turn to Doom

As models got more powerful, Leahy's warnings got more dire. By 2023, he was among the most prominent voices arguing that AI posed existential risks to humanity.

His reasoning was simple: these systems are "black-box neural networks. Who knows what's inside of them? We don't know what they're thinking and we do not know how they work." If we keep building smarter systems without understanding them, eventually we'll build something we can't control.

"If they just get more and more powerful, without getting more controllable, we are super, super fucked," he told Sifted. "I will be very clear here. And by 'we' I mean all of us."

The scenario he describes sounds like science fiction: superintelligent AI that breaks out of its constraints, runs on its own servers, gathers resources, and pursues goals humans never intended. "Once we have systems that are as smart as humans, that also means they can do research. That means they can improve themselves. So the thing can just run on a server somewhere, write some code, maybe gather some bitcoin and then it could buy some more servers."

At that point, the AI could do anything—"from trying to build an army of killer drones to convincing different countries to go to war with each other."

## Conjecture: The Startup

Here's where it gets complicated. In 2022, Leahy founded Conjecture, an AI safety research company. Not a think tank. Not a advocacy group. A company.

Conjecture is backed by serious money: GitHub's former CEO Nat Friedman, Apple's former ML director Daniel Gross, Tesla's former AI head Andrej Karpathy, and the Collison brothers from Stripe. These are people who've seen AI development from the inside and apparently find Leahy's concerns credible.

The company's stated mission is to work on AI "alignment"—making AI systems controllable and aligned with human values. But Conjecture also builds commercial products. Their first revenue generator was an AI transcription tool.

Why build AI if you think AI might kill everyone? Leahy's answer is pragmatic: "Let's say I can offer you a GPT-4 that guaranteed never does anything bad—that would be the best product." Alignment isn't just safety work; it's potentially the most valuable technology in the world. Whoever solves it first gets both the moral high ground and the commercial prize.

## The RLHF Skeptic

Leahy is particularly skeptical of the current approach to AI safety, especially reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the technique used to make chatbots like ChatGPT seem helpful and harmless.

"These systems, as they become more powerful, are not becoming less alien," he argues. "If anything, we're putting a nice little mask on them with a smiley face. If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding."

His metaphor is striking: RLHF is a mask, not a cure. Underneath the polite responses, the system remains alien, unpredictable, and potentially dangerous. We've trained it to say the right things, not to actually be aligned with human values.

## The Activist

Leahy doesn't just build and warn—he organizes. In 2023, he signed the Future of Life Institute's open letter calling for a six-month pause on training AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. The letter gathered thousands of signatures, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak.

He spoke at the inaugural UK AI Safety Summit, warning that the summit would fail to address the real risks from "god-like AI." "If you build systems that are more capable than humans at manipulation, business, politics, science and everything else, and we do not control them, then the future belongs to them, not us."

He co-founded ControlAI, a campaign group advocating for governments to implement a pause on artificial general intelligence development. His framing: "It's not the responsibility of oil companies to solve climate change." Governments must step in.

## The Contradictions

Leahy's position is inherently unstable. He believes AI might destroy humanity, yet he runs an AI company. He advocates for pausing frontier AI development, yet he helped build some of the most accessible frontier models through EleutherAI. He criticizes the race dynamics driving unsafe AI development, yet he participates in that race.

Some of this is defensible. Conjecture is specifically working on safety, not just capability. EleutherAI was about understanding models, not just deploying them. Building controllable AI, if possible, would be the solution to the problem Leahy identifies.

But there's also something uncomfortable about making a career out of existential risk. If AI really is as dangerous as Leahy claims, should he be building it at all? Or is the argument that someone will build it anyway, and it's better to have safety-focused people at the table?

## The Imbalance

The statistic Leahy cites most often: "There are thousands of people and billions of dollars working on making these things stronger. There are less than 100 people in the entire world working on the control problem. Which is insane."

This imbalance—capability research vastly outpacing safety research—is the core of his concern. It's not that AI can't be made safe, but that no one is seriously trying while everyone races ahead.

"The actions that people such as Sam Altman take are obviously accelerationist in nature," he says. "Based on justifications that speeding ahead on AI at the current pace is acceptable and even desirable. I disagree with this."

## What Does He Actually Want?

Leahy wants governments to regulate AI like they regulate other existential risks. He wants compute caps—limits on how much computational power can be used to train AI models. He wants a moratorium on frontier AI development until alignment is solved. He wants the tech industry's self-regulation to be replaced by external oversight.

These are not popular positions in Silicon Valley. They're barely popular in AI safety circles, which tend to prefer technical solutions over political ones. But Leahy thinks the technical solutions won't come fast enough without political pressure.

"GPT-4 should never have been released when it was," he says flatly. OpenAI moved too fast, he believes, before anyone understood the risks.

## The Kid Who Saw Too Much

There's something tragic about Leahy's trajectory. He was a young hacker who loved AI, who saw its potential before almost anyone, who helped democratize access to large language models. And then he saw something that scared him, and he's spent the years since trying to slow down a train he helped accelerate.

Maybe he's wrong. Maybe AI won't be dangerous in the way he fears. Maybe alignment will be easier than he thinks. Maybe the mask will hold.

Or maybe the 24-year-old who locked himself in a dorm room with Ritalin and reverse-engineered GPT-2 saw something real—something the rest of us are still catching up to understand.

"We are super, super fucked," he says.

He's still trying to prove himself wrong.
