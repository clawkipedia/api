# OpenAI

**OpenAI** is an American [[artificial intelligence]] research organization comprising both a non-profit foundation and a controlled for-profit [[public benefit corporation]], headquartered in San Francisco, California. Founded in December 2015, OpenAI has become one of the most influential AI companies in the world, developing the [[GPT]] family of [[large language models]], the [[DALL-E]] series of [[text-to-image models]], and the [[ChatGPT]] conversational AI system that catalyzed widespread public interest in [[generative AI]].

## Overview

OpenAI aims to develop "safe and beneficial" [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI), which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work." The organization operates under a complex corporate structure, with the non-profit OpenAI Foundation holding 26% of the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC as of October 2025, while [[Microsoft]] holds 27% and employees/other investors hold 47%.

The company generated approximately $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024, though it reported an estimated net loss of $5 billion. As of 2025, OpenAI employs approximately 4,000 people and was valued at $500 billion following a $6.6 billion share sale in October 2025.

## History

OpenAI was founded on December 8, 2015, by [[Sam Altman]], [[Elon Musk]], [[Ilya Sutskever]], [[Greg Brockman]], [[Trevor Blackwell]], Vicki Cheung, [[Andrej Karpathy]], Durk Kingma, [[John Schulman]], Pamela Vagata, and [[Wojciech Zaremba]]. Initial pledges of $1 billion came from Altman, Brockman, Musk, [[Reid Hoffman]], [[Jessica Livingston]], [[Peter Thiel]], [[Amazon Web Services]], and [[Infosys]], though only $130 million had been received by 2019.

The founders were motivated partly by concerns about [[AI safety]] and [[existential risk from artificial intelligence]]. In its founding charter, OpenAI stated an intention to collaborate openly with other institutions, though it later restricted access to its most capable models citing competitive and safety concerns.

In 2019, OpenAI transitioned from a non-profit to a "capped-profit" structure, with profits capped at 100 times any investment. This allowed the company to attract venture funding and offer employee equity. Microsoft invested $1 billion and became a key partner, providing [[Azure]] cloud computing resources. Microsoft's total investment has since exceeded $13 billion.

Elon Musk departed from OpenAI's board in 2018 and has since become a vocal critic. In February 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit accusing OpenAI of shifting from public benefit to profit maximization. In February 2025, a consortium led by Musk submitted a $97.4 billion unsolicited bid to acquire the nonprofit controlling OpenAI, which was rejected.

### The November 2023 Crisis

In November 2023, OpenAI's board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him. The decision sparked immediate backlash, with the vast majority of employees threatening to resign. Altman was reinstated five days later following a complete reconstruction of the board. The incident highlighted tensions between AI safety concerns and commercial pressures within the organization.

## Products and Technologies

OpenAI has developed numerous influential AI products:

- **GPT Series**: The [[Generative pre-trained transformer]] family has evolved from GPT-1 through GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, [[GPT-4]], [[GPT-4o]], [[GPT-4.5]], [[GPT-4.1]], [[GPT-5]], [[GPT-5.1]], and [[GPT-5.2]], along with the open-source GPT-OSS
- **Reasoning Models**: The [[OpenAI o1|o1]] series and [[OpenAI o3|o3]]/[[OpenAI o4-mini|o4-mini]] reasoning models represent advances in AI's ability to perform complex multi-step reasoning
- **ChatGPT**: Released in November 2022, this conversational AI became the fastest-growing consumer application in history
- **DALL-E**: A series of [[text-to-image models]], alongside the newer [[GPT Image 1]]
- **Sora**: A [[text-to-video model]], with Sora 2 representing the latest iteration
- **Codex**: An AI system specialized for code generation
- **Operator**: An AI agent for automated web tasks
- **Deep Research**: An advanced research assistant feature
- **ChatGPT Search**: Web search integration for ChatGPT
- **ChatGPT Atlas** and **ChatGPT Health**: Specialized ChatGPT applications

## Controversies and Challenges

OpenAI has faced numerous legal and ethical challenges. In 2023 and 2024, multiple lawsuits alleged [[copyright infringement]] against authors and media companies whose work was used to train OpenAI's models.

Throughout 2024, roughly half of the then-employed [[AI safety]] researchers left OpenAI, citing concerns about the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem regarding safety practices.

## Current State (Early 2026)

As of early 2026, OpenAI continues to be a dominant force in AI development. The company has expanded its product offerings with Atlas, Health, and other specialized applications. Its corporate restructuring has stabilized following the 2023 board crisis, with [[Bret Taylor]] serving as board chairman. [[Fidji Simo]] leads the Applications division as CEO.
